            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And for the time, there was no other time to compare it with; for this was the beginning of time, <hi>In the beginning God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heaven and earth.</hi> That earth, which in ſome thouſands of yeares men could not look over, nor diſcern what form it had (for neither <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius,</hi> almoſt three hundred yeares after Chriſt; nor <hi>S.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10526:4"/> yeares after him, would beleeve the earth to be round) That earth, which no man in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ever ſaid to have compaſſed till our age: That earth, which is too much for man yet (for as yet a very great part of the earth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled) That earth, which, if we will caſt it all but into a Map, coſts many moneths labour to grave it; nay, if we will but caſt a piece of an acre of it into a garden, coſts many yeares la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to faſhion and furniſh it; all that earth: And then that heaven, which ſpreads ſo farre, as that ſubtill men have, with ſome appearance of probabilitie, imagined, that in that heaven, in thoſe manifold Spheres of the Planets and the Starres, there are many earths, many worlds, as big as this which we inhabit: That earth and that heaven, which ſpent God himſelf, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, ſix dayes in finiſhing, Moſes ſets up in a few ſyllables, in one line, <hi>In princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, In the beginning God created heaven and earth.</hi> If a <hi>Livie</hi> or a <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> or ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and voluminous authours had had this ſtory in hand, God muſt have made another world, to have made them a library to hold their books, of the making of this world. Into what wire would they have drawn out this earth! Into what leaf-gold would they have beat out theſe heavens! It may aſſiſt our conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture herein, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that amongſt thoſe men, who proceed with a ſober modeſtie and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in their writing, &amp; make a conſcience not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10526:4"/> to clog the world with unneceſſary books; yet the volumes which are written by them, upon the beginning of Geneſis, are ſcarce leſſe then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. God did no more but ſay, Let this &amp; this be done; and Moſes doth no more but ſay, that upon Gods ſaying it was done. God required not Nature to help him to do it; Moſes required not Reaſon to help him to beleeve: The holy Ghoſt hovered upon the waters, and ſo God wrought; The holy Ghoſt hovered upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes too, and ſo he wrote: And we beleeve theſe things to be ſo, by the ſame Spirit in the mouth of Moſes, by which they were made ſo in Gods hand: Onely (Beloved) remember, that a frame may be thrown down in much leſſe time then it was ſet up. A childe, an ape can give fire to a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; and a vapour can ſhake the earth: and when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Throw down this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it,</hi> they never ſtood upon the conſideration of throwing it down; they knew that might be ſoon done: but they wondered at the ſpeedy raiſing of it. Now, if all this earth were made in that minute, may not all come to the generall diſſolution in this minute? Or may not thy acres, thy miles, thy ſhires ſhrink into feet, and ſo few feet, as ſhall but make up thy grave? when he who was a great lord muſt be but a cottager, &amp; not ſo wel; for a cottager muſt have ſo many acres to his cottage: but in this caſe, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle piece of an acre, five foot, is become the houſe it ſelf, the houſe and the land; the grave is all:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10526:5"/> lower then that, the grave is the land, and the tenement, &amp; the tenant too. He that lies in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſame earth that he lies in; they all make but one earth, and but a little of it. But then raiſe thy ſelf to a higher hope again: God hath made better land, the land of promiſe; a ſtronger citie, the new Jeruſalem; &amp; inhabitants for that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting citie, us, whom he made, not by ſaying, Let there be men; but by conſultation, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; <hi>God ſaid, Let us make man, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall purſue our great examples, God in <note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> doing, Moſes in ſaying, and ſo make haſte in applying the parts. But firſt receive them: and ſince we have the whole world in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſider in theſe words, the foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, by application, by fair and juſt accommodations of the words. Firſt, in the firſt word that God ſpeaks here, <hi>Faciamus, Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> in the plurall, (a denotation of divers perſons in the Godhead) we conſider our Eaſt, where we muſt begin, at the knowledge and confeſſion of the Trinity: for though in the way to heaven we have travelled beyond the Gentiles, when we come to confeſſe but one God (the Gentiles could not do that) yet we are ſtill among the Jews, if we think that one God to be but one perſon. Chriſts name is <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 6. 12.</note> the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> if we will be named by him, (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians) we muſt look to this Eaſt, the confeſſion of the Trinitie: there is then our Eaſt in the <hi>Faciamus; Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s make man:</hi> And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10526:5"/> then our Weſt is in the next word, <hi>Faciamus hominem:</hi> Though we be thus made; made by the councell, made by the concurrence, made by the hand of the whole Trinity: yet we are made but men; and man but in the appellation in this Text; and man there is but Adam; and Adam is but earth, but red earth, died red in bloud, in bloud, in ſoul, the bloud of our own ſouls. To that Weſt we muſt all come, to the earth; <hi>The ſunne knoweth his going down:</hi> even <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 19.</note> the ſunne, for all his glory and height, hath a going down, and he knows it. The higheſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deveſt mortality, nor the diſcomfort of mortality. <hi>When you ſee a cloud riſe out of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lue. 12. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>weſt, ſtraightway you ſay, There cometh a ſtorm,</hi> ſayes Chriſt: When out of the region of your Weſt, (that is, your latter dayes) there comes a cloud, a ſickneſſe; you feel a ſtorm: even the beſt morall conſtancie is ſhaken. But this cloud, and this ſtorm, and this Weſt there muſt be; and that is our ſecond conſideration. But then the next word deſignes a North, a ſtrong and powerfull NOrth, to ſcatter and diſſipate theſe clouds: <hi>Ad imaginem &amp; ſimilitudinem;</hi> that we are made according to a pattern, to an image, to a likeneſſe, which God propoſed to himſelf for the making of man. This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that God did not reſt in that preexiſtent matter, out of which he made all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and produced their forms out of their matter, for the making of man; but took a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10526:6"/> form, a pattern, a modell for that work: This is the North-winde that is called upon to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 16.</note> out the perfumes of the garden, to ſpread the goodneſſe of God abroad: this is that which is intended in Job; <hi>Fair weather cometh out of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job. 37. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>North.</hi> Our Weſt, our declination is in this, that we are but earth; our North, our diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that darkneſſe is in this, that we are not all earth: though we be of that matter, we have on another form, another image, another likeneſſe. And then whoſe image and likeneſſe it is, is our Meridionall height, our Noon, our South-point, our higheſt elevation; <hi>In imagine nostra, Let us make man in our image.</hi> Though our ſunne ſet at noon, as the prophet <hi>Amos</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Amos 8. 9.</note> ſpeaks; though we die in our youth, or fall in our height; yet even in that ſunne-ſet we ſhall have a noon: for this image of God ſhall never depart from our ſoul, no not when that ſoul departs from our bodie: And that is our South, our Meridionall height and glory. And when we have thus ſeen this Eaſt, in the <hi>Faciamus;</hi> that I am the workmanſhip and care of the whole Trinitie; and this Weſt, in the <hi>Hominem;</hi> that for all this, my matter, my ſubſtance is but earth; But then a North, a power of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that law and miſerable ſtate, <hi>In imagine;</hi> that though in my matter the earth, I muſt die; yet in my form, in that image which I am made by, I cannot die: And after all, a South, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this image is not the image of angels
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10526:6"/> themſelves, to whom we ſhall be like; but it is by the ſame life by which thoſe angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were made, the image of God himſelf: when I have gone over this Eaſt, and Weſt, and North, &amp; South here in this world, I ſhould be ſorie, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was, if there were no more worlds. But there is another world, which theſe conſiderations will diſcover and leade us to, in which our joy and our glorie ſhall be to ſee that God eſſentially, and face to face, after whoſe image and likeneſſe we were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But as that Pilot, which hath harboured his ſhip ſo farre within land, as that he muſt have change of windes, in all the points of the compaſſe, to bring her out, cannot hope to bring her out in one day: ſo being to tranſport you by occaſion of theſe words, from this world to the next, and in this world, through all the compaſſe, all the foure quarters thereof; I cannot hope to make all this voyage to day. To day we ſhall conſider our longitude, our Eaſt and Weſt; and our North and South at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other tide and another gale.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then we look towards our Eaſt, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>1</label> of light and life; There this world began: <note place="margin">Oriens.</note> The creation was in the Eaſt, and there our next world began too: there the gates of heaven opened to us, and opened to us in the gates of death: for our heaven is the death of our Saviour, and there he lived, and died there, and there he looked into our Weſt, from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10526:7"/> Eaſt, from his terraſſe, from his pinacle, from his exaltation (as himſelf calls it) the Croſſe. The light which ariſes to us in this Eaſt, the knowledge which we receive in this firſt word of our text, <hi>Faciamus, Let us</hi> (where God, ſpeaking of himſelf, ſpeaks in the plurall) is the manifeſtation of the Trinitie; The Trinitie, which is the firſt letter in his Alphabet, that ever thinks to reade his name in the Book of life; the firſt note in his Gammut, that ever thinks to ſing his part in the Triumphant Church. Let him have done as much as all the worthies, and ſuffer as much as all natures martyrs, the penurious Philoſophers; let him have known as much as they pretend to know, <hi>Omne ſcibile,</hi> all that can be known; nay, and <hi>In-intelligibilia, In-inveſtigabilia</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks) un-underſtandable things, unrevea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led decrees of God: let him have writ as much as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writ, or as is written upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (which is multiplication enough) yet he hath not learned to ſpell, that hath not learned the Trinitie: he hath not learned to pronounce the firſt word, that cannot bring three perſons into one God. The ſubject of naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, are the foure elements, which God made: the ſubject of ſupernaturall Philoſophie, Divinitie, are the three elements which God is; and (if we may ſo ſpeak) which make God, that is, conſtitute God, notifie God to us, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10526:7"/> man, that hearkens to his own heart, and the law written there, may produce acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are good; good in the nature, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſubſtance of the work: he may relieve the poore, he may defend the oppreſſed; but yet he is but as an open field: and though he be not abſolutely barren, he bears but graſſe. The godly man, he that hath taken in the knowledge of a great and powerfull God, and incloſed and hedged in himſelf with the fear of God, may produce actions better then the meer nature of man, becauſe he referres his actions to the glorie of an imagined God: but yet this man, though he be more fruitfull then the former, more then a graſſie field, is but a ploughed field, and bears but corn, and corn (God knows) choked with weeds. But the man that hath taken hold of God, by thoſe handles, by which God hath delivered and manifeſted himſelf, in the notions of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt; he is no field, but a garden, a garden of Gods planting, paradiſe, in which grow all things good to eat, and good to ſee (ſpirituall refection, and ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation too) and all things good to cure: he hath his being, and his diet, and his phyſick there, in the knowledge of the Trinitie: his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the mercie of the Father; his phyſick, in the merits of his Sonne; his diet, his daily bread, in the daily viſitations of the holy Ghoſt. God is not pleaſed, not ſatisfied with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10526:8"/> our bare knowledge that there is a God; for, <hi>it is impoſsible to pleaſe God without faith:</hi> and <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 6.</note> there is no ſuch exerciſe of faith in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a God, but that reaſon and nature will bring a man to it. When we profeſſe God in the Creed, by way of belief, <hi>Credo in Deum, I beleeve in God;</hi> in the ſame article we profeſſe him to be a Father too; <hi>I beleeve in God the Father Almightie:</hi> and that notion, the <hi>Father,</hi> neceſſarily implies a ſecond perſon, a <hi>Sonne.</hi> And then we profeſſe him to be <hi>maker of heaven and earth:</hi> and in the creation the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, the Spirit of God, is expreſſely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: ſo that we do but exerciſe reaſon and nature in directing our ſelves upon God: we exerciſe not Faith (and <hi>without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to pleaſe God)</hi> till we come to that which is above nature, till we apprehend a Trinitie: we know God, we beleeve in the Trinitie. The Gentiles multiplied gods; there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many gods as men that beleeved in them; and I am got out of that throng, and out of that noiſe, when I am come into the knowledge of one God: but I am got above ſtairs, got into the bed-chamber, when I am come to ſee the Trinitie, and to apprehend not onely, that I am in the care of a great &amp; power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, but that there is a Father that made me, a Sonne that redeemed me, a holy Ghoſt that applies this good purpoſe of the Father and Sonne upon me, to me. The root of all is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10526:8"/> God. But it is not the way to receive fruits, to dig to the root, but to reach to the boughs. I reach for my creation, to the Father; for my redemption, to the Sonne; for my ſanctification, to the holy Ghoſt: and ſo I make the knowledge of God a tree of life unto me, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Truely it is a ſad contemplation to ſee Chriſtians ſcratch, and wound, and teare one another with the ignominious invectives and uncharitable names of Heretick and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, about ceremoniall and problematicall, and indeed but criticall verball controverſies; and in the mean time, the foundation of all, the Trinitie, undermined by thoſe numerous, thoſe multitudinous ant-hills of Socinians, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow ſome parts of the Chriſtian world, and multiply every where. And therefore the adverſaries of the Reformation were wiſe in their generation, when, to ſupplant the credit of both thoſe great aſſiſtants of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Calvin,</hi> they impute to <hi>Calvin</hi> fundamentall errour in the divinitie of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon of the Trinitie, the Sonne; And they impute to <hi>Luther</hi> a deteſtation of the word <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and an expunction thereof, in all places of the Liturgie, where the Church had received that word: They knew well, if that ſlander could prevail againſt thoſe perſons, nothing that they could ſay, could prevail upon any good Chriſtians. But though in our <hi>Doctrine</hi> we keep up the Trinitie aright; yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10526:9"/> God knows, in our <hi>Practiſe</hi> we do not: I hope it cannot be ſaid of any of us, that he beleeves not the Trinitie: but who amongſt us thinks of the Trinitie, conſiders of the Trinitie? Father and Sonne do naturally imply and induce one another, &amp; therefore they fall oftener into our conſideration; but for the holy Ghoſt, who feels him, when he feels him? who takes knowledge of his working, when he works? Indeed our Fathers provided not well enough for the worſhip of the whole Trinitie, nor of the holy Ghoſt in particular, in the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, and conſecrations of the Churches, and poſſeſſions in their names: what a ſpirituall dominion in the Prayers &amp; worſhip of the people, what a temporall dominion in the poſſeſſions of the world, had the Virgin Marie, Queen of heaven, and Queen of earth too! She was made joynt-purchaſer of the Church with the Sonne, and had aſmuch of the worſhip thereof as he, though ſhe paid her Fine in milk, and he in bloud: And, till a new ſect came in her Sonnes name, and in his name, the name of Jeſus, took the Regencie ſo farre out of that Queen-mothers hands, and ſued out her ſonnes liverie ſo farre, as that, though her name be uſed, the Virgin Marie is but a Feofee in truſt for them; all was hers. And if God op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not theſe new uſurpers of the world, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie will ſoon ſee S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> worth all the Trinitie in poſſeſſions and endowments; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10526:9"/> that ſumptuous and ſplendid foundation of his firſt Temple at Rome, may well create a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture and ſuſpicion. Travell no farther; Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey but this Citie, and, of their not one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Churches, the Virgin Marie hath a dozen: The Trinitie hath but one; Chriſt hath but one; the holy Ghoſt hath none. But not to go into the Citie, nor out of our ſelves, which of us doth truely &amp; conſiderately aſcribe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that he receives in dangers or in diſtreſſes, to that God of all comfort, the Comforter, the holy Ghoſt? We know who procured us our preſentation, and our diſpenſation: you know who procured you your offices, and your honours: Shall I ever forget who gave me my comfort in ſickneſſe? who gave me my comfort in the troubles, and perplexities, and diffidencies of my conſcience? The holy Ghoſt, the holy Ghoſt brought you hither; The holy Ghoſt opens your eares and your hearts here. Till in all your diſtreſſes you ſay, <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus, Come holy Ghoſt;</hi> and that you feel a comfort in his coming: you can never ſay, <hi>Veni Domine Jeſu, Come Lord Jeſus, come to judgement.</hi> Never to conſider the day of judgement, is a fearfull thing; but to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the day of judgement without the holy Ghoſt, is a thouſand times more fearfull.</p>
                  <p>This ſeal then, this impreſſion, this notion of the Trinitie, being ſet upon us in this firſt plurall word of our Text, <hi>Faciamus, Let us</hi> (for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10526:10"/> Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt made man) and this ſeal being reimprinted upon us in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Creation, or Regeneration, in Baptiſme, (man is baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt) this notion of the Trinitie, being our diſtinctive character from Jew and Gentile; this being our ſpecificall form; why doth not this our form, this ſoul of our Religion denominate us? why are we not called <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> a name that would embrace the profeſſion of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but onely <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which limits and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines us upon one? The firſt Chriſtians, amongſt whoſe manifold perſecutions, ſcorn and contempt was not the leaſt, in contempt and ſcorn were called <hi>Nazaraei, Nazarites,</hi> in the mouth of the vulgar; and <hi>Galilaei, Galileans,</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Julian;</hi> &amp; <hi>Judaei, Jews,</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Nero,</hi> when he imputed the burning of Rome (his own art) to them; and <hi>Chriſtiani, Chriſtians,</hi> ſo that (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes) they could accuſe Chriſtians of nothing, but the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and yet they could not call them by their right name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which was gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, quiet, eaſie, patient men, made to be troden upon; but they gave them divers names in ſcorn, yet never called them <hi>Trinitarians.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians themſelves amongſt themſelves were called by divers names in the Primitive Church, for diſtinction; <hi>Fideles, the Faithfull;</hi> and <hi>Fratres, the Brethren;</hi> and <hi>Diſcipuli, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:10526:10"/> &amp; after, by common cuſtome at Antioch, <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> and after that (they ſay, by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell which the Apoſtles held at the ſame Citie, at Antioch) there paſſed an expreſſe Canon of the Church, that they ſhould be called ſo, <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And before they had this name at Antioch, firſt by common uſage, after by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Canon, to be called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> at Alexandria, they were called (moſt likely from the name of <hi>Jeſus) Jeſſeans.</hi> And ſo <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> in that book which he writes <hi>de Jeſſaeis,</hi> intends by his <hi>Jeſſeans, Chriſtians.</hi> And in divers parts of the world, into which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians travell now, they finde ſome elements, ſome fragments, ſome reliques of the Chriſtian religion, in the practiſe of ſome religious men, whom thoſe Countreys call <hi>Jeſſeans,</hi> doubtleſly derived and continued from the name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> So that the Chriſtians took many names to themſelves for diſtinction (Brethren, Diſciples, Faithfull) and they had many names put upon them in ſcorn (Nazarites, Galileans, Jews, Chriſtians) &amp; yet they were never by cuſtome amongſt themſelves, never by commandment from the Church, never in contempt from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, called <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> the profeſſion of the Trinitie being their ſpecifick form, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive character. Why ſo? Beloved, the name of Chriſt involved all: not onely becauſe it is a name that hath a dignitie in it, more then the reſt (for Chriſt is an anointed perſon, a King,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10526:11"/> a Meſſiah; and ſo the profeſſion of that name conferres an unction, a regall and a holy unction upon us, for we are thereby a royall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) but becauſe in the profeſſion of Chriſt, the whole Trinitie is profeſſed. How often doth the Sonne ſay that the Father ſent him! And how often that the Father will, and that he will ſend the holy Ghoſt! <hi>This is life eternall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 17. 3.</note> (ſayes he) <hi>to know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent;</hi> and ſent with all power in heaven and in earth. This muſt be profeſſed, Father and Sonne; and then no man can profeſſe this, no man can call Jeſus the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt: So that as in the perſecutions in the Primitive Church, the Martyrs which were hurried to tumultuary executions, and could not be heard for noiſe, in excuſing themſelves of treaſon, and ſedition, &amp; crimes imputed to them, to make their cauſe odious, did uſe in the ſight of the people (who might ſee a geſture, though they could not heare a proteſtation) to ſigne themſelves with the ſigne of the Croſſe, to let them know for what profeſſion they died; ſo that the ſigne of the Croſſe, in that uſe thereof, in that time, was an Abridgement and a Catechiſme of the whole Chriſtian religion: So is the profeſſing of the name of Chriſt, the profeſſing of the whole Trinitie. As he that confeſſeth one God, is got beyond the meer naturall man; And he that confeſſeth a Sonne of God, beyond him: ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10526:11"/> is neither got to the full truth, till he confeſſe the holy Ghoſt too. <hi>The fool ſayes in his heart, There is no God: The fool,</hi> ſayes David; the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall fool, in the higheſt degree of folly: But though he get beyond that folly, he is a fool ſtill, if he ſay, There is no Chriſt; for Chriſt is the wiſdome of the Father: And a fool ſtill, if he denie the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Etiam Chriſtiani nomen ſuperficies eſt,</hi> is excellently ſaid by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian;</hi> The name and profeſſion of a Chriſtian, is but a ſuperficiall outſide, ſprinkled upon my face in Baptiſme, or upon my outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in actions, if I have not in my heart a ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, that applies the mercies of the Father, and the merits of the Sonne to my ſoul. As S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, Whileſt you are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, you are without God; It is an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme (with S. <hi>Paul)</hi> to be no Chriſtian: So whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt you are without the holy Ghoſt, you are without Chriſt. It is Antichriſtian to denie, or not to confeſſe the holy Ghoſt. For as Chriſt is the manifeſtation of the Father, ſo the holy Ghoſt is the application of the Sonne. Therein are we Chriſtians, that in the profeſſion of that name of Chriſt, we profeſſe all the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: In Chriſt is the whole Trinitie; becauſe, as the Father ſent him, ſo ſent he the holy Ghoſt: And that is our ſpecifick form; that is our diſtinctive character from Jew &amp; Gentile, the Trinitie.</p>
                  <p>But then is this ſpecifick form, this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10526:12"/> character, the notion of the Trinitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us, exhibited, imprinted upon us in our creation in this word, this plurall word, in the mouth of our own God, <hi>Faciamus, Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> It is here, and here firſt. This is an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the firſt intimation of the Trinitie from the mouth of God, in all the Bible. It is true, that though the ſame faith, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation now, were alwayes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo in the old Teſtament they were bound to beleeve in Chriſt, as well as in the new, and conſequently in the whole Trinitie; yet not ſo explicitely, nor ſo particularly as now: now Chriſt, calling upon God, in the name of the Father, ſayes, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 17. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>the world.</hi> They were men appropriated to God, men exempt out of the world: yet they had not a cleare manifeſtation of Father and Sonne, the doctrine of the Trinitie, till Chriſt manifeſted it to them. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name,</hi> thy name of Father and Sonne. And therefore the Jewiſh Rabbins ſay, that the Septuagint, the firſt Tranſlatours of the Bible, did diſguiſe ſome places of the Scriptures, in their tranſlation, leſt <hi>Ptolomey</hi> (for whom they tranſlated it) ſhould be ſcandalized with thoſe places: And that this text was one of thoſe places, which, (ſay they) though it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the copies of the Scriptures which we have now, they tranſlated <hi>Faciam,</hi> and not <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciamus:</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:10526:12"/> that God ſaid here, <hi>I will make,</hi> in the ſingular, and not, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; leſt that plurall word might have miſled King <hi>Ptolomey</hi> to think that the Jews had a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall religion, and worſhipped divers gods. So good an evidence do they confeſſe this text to be, for ſome kinde of pluralitie in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
                  <p>Here then God notified the Trinitie; and here firſt. For though we accept an intimation of the Trinitie, in the firſt line of the Bible, where <hi>Moſes</hi> joyned a plurall name, <hi>Elohim,</hi> with a ſingular verb, <hi>Bara;</hi> and ſo in conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it is <hi>Creavit Dii, Gods created heaven and earth:</hi> yet beſides that, that is rather a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious collection, then an evident concluſion of a pluralitie of perſons: though we reade that in that firſt verſe, before this in the 26; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> writ that, which is in the beginning of this chapter, more then 2000. yeares after God ſpake this that is in our text: ſo long was Gods plurall before <hi>Moſes</hi> his plurall; Gods <hi>Faciamus</hi> before <hi>Moſes Bara Elohim.</hi> So that in this text begins our Catechiſme: here we have (and here firſt) the ſaving knowledge of the Trinitie. For, when God ſpake here, to whom could God ſpeak, but to God? <hi>Non cum rebus crean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, non cum re nihili,</hi> ſayes <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſpeaking of Gods firſt ſpeaking, when he ſaid of the firſt creature, <hi>Let there be light.</hi> God ſpake not then to future things, that were not. When God
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10526:13"/> ſpake firſt, there was no creature at all to ſpeak to: when God ſpake of the making of man, there were no creatures. But were there any creatures able to create, or able to aſſiſt him in the creation of man? who? Angels? ſome had thought ſo in S. <hi>Baſils</hi> time; and to them S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> ſayes, <hi>Súntne illi?</hi> God ſayes, <hi>Let us make man to our image;</hi> and could he ſay ſo to Angels? Are Angels and God all one? or is that that is like an Angel, therefore like God? It was <hi>ſua ratio, ſuum verbum, ſua ſapientia,</hi> ſayes that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: God ſpake to his own word and wiſdome; to his own purpoſe and goodneſſe: And the Sonne is the word and wiſdome of God; and the holy Ghoſt is the goodneſſe and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, that is, the adminiſtration, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his Church. It is true, that when God ſpeaks this over again, in the Church (as he doth every day, now this minute) then God ſpeaks to his Angels, to the Angels of the Church, to his Miniſters: he ſayes, <hi>Faciamus, Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> both together, you and we, make a man: joyn mine ordinance (your preaching) with my Spirit (ſayes God to us) and ſo make man: Preach the oppreſſour, and preach the wanton; and preach the calumniatour, into an other nature; make that ravening wolf, a man; that licentious goat, a man; that inſinuating ſerpent, a man by thy preaching. To day if you will heare his voice, heare us; for here he calls upon us to joyn with him for the making of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10526:13"/> man. But for his firſt <hi>Faciamus,</hi> which is in our text, it is excellently ſaid, <hi>Dictum in ſenatu, &amp;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rupertus.</note> 
                     <hi>ſoliloquio: It was ſpoken in a ſenate, and yet in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſſe;</hi> ſpoken in private, and yet publiquely ſpoken; ſpoken where there were divers, and yet but one, one God, and three perſons.</p>
                  <p>If there were no more intended in this plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall expreſſion, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> but (as ſome have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that God ſpake here in the perſon of a Prince and Soveraigne Lord; and therefore ſpake, as Princes do, in the plurall, We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and we forbid: yet S. <hi>Gregories</hi> caution would juſtly fall upon it, <hi>Reverenter penſandum eſt,</hi> It requires reverent conſideration, if it be but ſo: for God ſpeaks ſo, like a King, in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but ſeldome, but five times (in my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt) in all the ſcriptures; and in all five, in caſes of important conſequence. In this text firſt, where God creates man, whom he conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes his vice-Roy in the world; here he ſpeaks in his Royall plurall: And then in the next Chapter, where he exempts mans term in this vice-regencie to the end of the world, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding man means of ſucceſſion; <hi>Faciamus, Let us make him a helper:</hi> there he ſpeaks in his Royall plurall. And alſo in the third Chapter, in declaring the hainouſneſſe of mans fault, &amp; arraigning him, and all us in him, God ſayes, <hi>Sicut unus ex nobis, Man is become as one of us,</hi> not content to be our vice-Roy, but our ſelves: there is his Royall plurall too: And again, in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10526:14"/> that declaration of his juſtice, in that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the builders of Babylon, <hi>Deſcendamus, Confundamus, Let us do it.</hi> And then laſtly, in that great work of mingling mercy with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which (if we may ſo ſpeak) is Gods maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, when he ſayes, <hi>Quis ex nobis? Who will go for us, and publiſh this?</hi> In theſe places, &amp; theſe onely (and not all theſe neither, if we take it exactly according to the originall; for in the ſecond, the making of <hi>Eve,</hi> though the vulgar have it in the plurall, it is indeed but ſingular in the Hebrew) God ſpeaks as a King, in his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all plurall ſtill. And when it is but ſo, <hi>Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter penſandum eſt,</hi> ſayes that Father, <hi>It behoves us to hearken reverently to him,</hi> for kings are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God; ſuch images of God, as have eares, and can heare; and hands, and can ſtrike. But I would ask no more premeditation at your hands, when you come to ſpeak to God in this place, then if you ſued to ſpeak with the King: to ſpeak with no more fear of God here, then if you went to the King under the conſcience of a guiltineſſe towards him, and a knowledge that he knew it. And that is your caſe here; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and even manifeſt ſinners: for even mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night is noon in the ſight of God; and when your candles are put out, his ſunne ſhines ſtill. <hi>Nec quid abſconditum à calore ejus</hi> (ſayes David) <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>There is nothing hid from the heat thereof:</hi> not onely no ſin hid from the light thereof, from the ſight of God; but not from the heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10526:14"/> not from the wrath and indignation of God. If God ſpeak plurally, onely in the majeſtie of a ſoveraigne Prince, ſtill <hi>Reverenter penſandum,</hi> that calls for reverence. What reverence? There are nationall differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in outward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and worſhips: ſome worſhip princes, and parents, and maſters, in one; ſome in another faſhion: children kneel to ask bleſſing of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in England; but where elſe? ſervants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not with the ſame reverence upon maſters in other nations, as with us: Acceſſes to their princes, are not with the ſame difficultie, nor the ſame ſolemnitie in France, as in Turkie. But this rule goes through all nations, that in that diſpoſition, and poſture, and action of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which in that place is eſteemed moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reverent, God is to be worſhipped. Do ſo then here. God is your Father; ask bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon your knees; pray in that poſture: God is your King; worſhip him with that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is higheſt in our uſe &amp; eſtimation. We have no Grandes, that ſtand covered to the King: where there are ſuch, though they ſtand covered in the Kings preſence, they do not ſpeak to him for matters of grace, they do not ſue to him: ſo, ancient Canons make difference of perſons in the preſence of God: where and how this and this ſhall diſpoſe of themſelves in the Church of God, dignitie, and age, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie will induce differences. But for prayer, there is no difference: one humiliation is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10526:15"/> of all: As when the King comes in here, howſoever they ſat diverſly before, all return to one manner of expreſſing their acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his preſence: ſo at the <hi>Oremus, Let us pray, Let us all fall down, and worſhip, and kneel before the Lord our maker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So he ſpeaks in our Text: not onely as the Lord our King, intimating his providence and adminiſtration; but as the Lord our maker; and then a maker ſo, as that he made us in a Councell; <hi>Faciamus, Let us:</hi> and that he ſpeaks as in councel, is an other argument for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For what truſt or freedome ſoever I have by his favour with any Counſellour of ſtate; yet I ſhould ſurely uſe another manner of conſideration to this pluralitie in God, to this meeting in Councel, to this intimation of a Trinitie, then to thoſe other actions, in which God is preſented to us ſingly, as one God; for ſo he is preſented to the naturall man as well as to us. And here enters the neceſſitie of this knowledge, <hi>O portet denuo naſci;</hi> without a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth, no ſalvation: And ſo no ſecond birth without Baptiſme, no Baptiſme, but in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. It was the entertainment of God himſelf, his delight, his contemplation, for thoſe infinite millions of generations, when he was without a world, without creatures, to joy in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Trinitie, as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene,</hi> and a Poet as well as a Father, as moſt of the Fathers were, expreſſes it:</p>

It was Gods own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and it muſt be the delight of every Chriſtian, upon particular occaſions to carry his thoughts upon the ſeverall perſons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. If I have a barre of iron, that barre in that form will not nail a doore: If a ſow of lead, that lead in that form will not ſtop a leak: If a wedge of gold, that wedge will not buy my bread. The generall notion of a mighty God, may leſſe fit my particular purpoſes: But I coyn my gold into currant money, when I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God in the ſeverall notions of the Trinitie; That, if I have been a prodigall ſon, I have a Father in heaven, and can go to him, and ſay, <hi>Father, I have ſinned,</hi> and be received by him; That, if I be a decayed father, and need the ſuſtentation of my own children, there is a Sonne in heaven, that will do more for me then my own children (of what good means or good nature ſoever they be) can or will do; If I be dejected in ſpirit, there is a holy Spirit in heaven, which ſhall bear witneſſe to my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that I am a childe of God: And if the ghoſts of thoſe ſinners, whom I made ſinners,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10526:16"/> haunt me after their deaths, in returning to my memorie, &amp; reproaching my conſcience with the heavy judgements that I have brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; If after the death of my own ſinne, when my appetite is dead to ſome particular ſinne, the memorie and ſinfull delight of thoſe paſſed ſinnes, the ghoſts of thoſe ſinnes haunt me again: yet there is a holy Ghoſt in heaven, that ſhall exorciſe theſe, and ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow me. The God of the whole world is God alone, in the generall notion, as he is ſo, God; but he is my God moſt eſpecially, &amp; moſt appliably, as he is received by me in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall notions of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>This is our Eaſt; here we ſee God, God in <label type="milestone">

But then my Weſt preſents it ſelf; that is an occaſion to humble me, in the next word: he makes but man; a man, that is, but Adam, but Earth. I remember 4. names, by which man is often called in the ſcriptures: &amp; of theſe foure, three do abſolutely carry mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie in their ſignifications; three to one againſt any man, that he is miſerable: One name of man is <hi>Iſh;</hi> and that they derive <hi>à ſonitu;</hi> Man is but a voice, but a ſound, but a noiſe: he begins the noiſe himſelf, when he comes crying into the world; &amp; when he goes out, perchance friends celebrate, perchance enemies calumniate him, with a diverſe voice, a diverſe noiſe. A melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick man is but a groning; a ſportfull man,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10526:16"/> but a ſong; an active man, but a trumpet; a mighty man, but a thunder-clap: every man but <hi>Iſh,</hi> but a ſound, but a noyſe. An other name is <hi>Enoſh. Enoſh,</hi> is meer calamitie, miſerie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. It is indeed moſt properly oblivion; And ſo the word is moſt elegantly uſed by David, <hi>Quid eſt homo?</hi> where the name of man is <hi>Enoſh:</hi> And ſo that which we tranſlate, <hi>What is man, that thou art mindfull of him?</hi> is indeed, <hi>What is forgetfulneſſe, that thou ſhouldeſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it;</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt think of that man, whom all the world hath forgotten? firſt man is but a voice, but a ſound: but becauſe fame &amp; honour may come within that name of a ſound, of a voice; therefore he is overtaken with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other damp, man is but oblivion: his fame, his name ſhall be forgotten. One name man hath, that hath ſome taſte of greatneſſe and power in it, <hi>Gheber;</hi> and yet, <hi>I that am that man</hi> (ſayes the Prophet, for there that name of man <hi>Gheber</hi> is uſed) <hi>I am the man that hath ſeen affliction by</hi>

                     <hi>the rod of Gods wrath.</hi> Man <hi>Iſh</hi> is ſo miſerable, as that he afflicts himſelf, cries, and whines out his own time; and man <hi>Enoſh,</hi> ſo miſerable, as that others afflict him, and bury him in ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious oblivion: and man, that is, <hi>Gheber,</hi> the greateſt &amp; powerfulleſt of men, is yet but that man, that may poſſibly, that may juſtly ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction by the rod of Gods wrath. And from <hi>Gheber,</hi> he made <hi>Adam,</hi> which is the fourth name of man, indeed the firſt name of man, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10526:17"/> name in this text, and the name to which every man muſt be called, and referre himſelf, and call himſelf by; earth, and red earth.</p>
                  <p>Now God did not ſay of man, as of other creatures, Let us, or let the earth bring forth herbs, and fruits, and trees, as upon the third day; Now let the earth bring forth cattell and worms, as upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſixth day, the ſame day that he made man: <hi>Non imperiali verbo, ſed familiari manu,</hi> ſayes <hi>Tertullian;</hi> God calls not man out with an imperious command, but he leads him out with a familiar, with his own hand. And it is not, <hi>Fiat homo,</hi> but, <hi>Faciamus;</hi> not, <hi>Let there be,</hi> but, <hi>Let us make man.</hi> Man is but an earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. It is true: but when we are upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, God is the potter: if God will be that, I am well content to be this: let me be any thing, ſo that that I am be from my God. I am as well content to be a ſheep as a lion, ſo God will be my ſhepherd; and the Lord is my ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: to be a cottage, as a caſtle; the houſe, as a citie, ſo God will be the builder: and the Lord builds, and watches the citie, the houſe; this houſe, this citie, me: to be rye, as wheat, ſo God will be the husbandman: and the Lord plants me, and waters, and weeds, and gives the increaſe: and to be clothed in leather, as well as in ſilk, ſo God will be the merchant: and he clothed me in <hi>Adam,</hi> and aſſures me of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in clothing the lilies of the field; and is fitting the robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10526:17"/> me now this minute: <hi>Adam</hi> is as good to me, as <hi>Gheber;</hi> a clod of earth, as a hill of earth, ſo God be the potter.</p>
                  <p>God made man of earth, not of aire, not of fire. Man hath many offices, that appertain to this world, and whileſt he is here, muſt not withdraw himſelf from thoſe offices of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſocietie, upon pretence of zeal, or better ſerving God in a retired life. A ſhip will no more come to the harbour without ballaſt, then without ſails: A man will no more get to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without diſcharging his duties to other men, then without doing them to God himſelf: <hi>Man liveth not by bread onely,</hi> ſayes Chriſt; but <note place="margin">Luke 4. 4.</note> yet he liveth by bread too: every man muſt do the duties, every man muſt bear the encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of ſome calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pulvis es, Thou art earth:</hi> he whom thou treadeſt upon, is no leſſe; and he that treads upon thee, is no more. Poſitively, it is a low thing to be but earth: and yet the low earth, is the quiet center: there may be reſt, acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, content in the loweſt condition: But comparatively, earth is as high as the higheſt. Challenge him that magnifies himſelf above thee, to meet thee in <hi>Adam;</hi> there bid him, if he will have more nobilitie, more greatneſſe then thou, take more originall ſin then thou haſt. If God have ſubmitted thee to as much ſin, and penalty of ſin, as him; he hath afforded thee as much, and as noble earth as him. And if
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10526:18"/> he will not trie it in the root, in your equalitie in <hi>Adam;</hi> yet, in another teſt, another furnace, in the grave, he muſt: there all duſts are equall. Except an epitaph tell me who lies there, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell by the duſt; nor by the epitaph know, which is the duſt it ſpeaks of, if another have been layed there before, or after, in the ſame grave: nor can any epitaph be confident in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Here lies; but, Here was laid: for ſo various, ſo viciſſitudinarie is all this world, as that even the duſt of the grave hath revolutions. As the motions of an upper ſphere imprint a motion in a lower ſphere, other then naturally it would have; ſo the changes of the life work after death. And as envie ſupplants and removes us alive; a ſhovell removes us, and throwes us out of our grave, after death. No limbeck, no weights can tell you, This is duſt royall, this plebeian duſt: no commiſſion, no inquiſition can ſay, This is catholick, this is hereticall duſt. All lie alike, and all ſhall riſe alike: alike, that is, at once, and upon one command. The ſaint cannot accelerate, the reprobate cannot retard the reſurrection. And all that riſe to the right hand, ſhall be equally kings; and all at the left, equally what? the worſt name we can call them by, or affect them with, is devil: and then they ſhall have bodies to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in, which devils have not. Miſerable, unexpreſſible, unimaginable, macerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the ſufferer would be glad to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10526:18"/> but a devil; where it were ſome happineſſe, and ſome kinde of life, to be able to die; and a great preferment, to be nothing!</p>
                  <p>He made us all of earth, and all of red earth: our earth was red, even when it was in Gods hands: a redneſſe that amounts to a ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to a bluſhing at our infirmities, is imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us by Gods hands: for this redneſſe is but a conſcience, a guiltineſſe of needing a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſupply, and ſucceſſion of more and more grace: and we are all red, red ſo, even from the beginning, and in our beſt ſtate. <hi>Adam</hi> had, the angels had thus much of this infirmitie, that though they had a great meaſure of grace, they needed more. The prodigall childe grew poore enough after he had received his portion: and he may be wicked enough, that truſts upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or preſent grace, and ſeeks not more. This redneſſe, a bluſhing, that is, an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we could not ſubſiſt with any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith, except we pray for more faith; nor of grace, except we ſeek more grace, we have from the hand of God: and an other redneſſe from his hand too, the bloud of his Sonne; for that bloud was effuſed by Chriſt, in the vail of this ranſome for us all, and accepted by God in the vail thereof for us all: and this redneſſe is in the nature thereof as extenſive, as the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe derived from <hi>Adam</hi> is: both reach to all; ſo we were red earth in the hands of God, as redneſſe denotes our generall infirmities: and as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10526:19"/> redneſſe denotes the bloud of his Sonne, our Saviour, all have both. But that redneſſe which we have contracted from bloud ſhed by our ſelves, the bloud of our own ſouls, by ſinne, was not upon us when we were in the hands of God: that redneſſe is not his tincture, not his complexion: no decree of his is writ in any ſuch red ink. Our ſins are our own, &amp; our deſtruction is from our ſelves. We are not as acceſſaries, and God as principall in this ſoul-murder: God forbid. We are not as executioners of Gods ſentence, and God the malefactour in this ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damnation: God forbid. <hi>Cain</hi> came not red in his brothers bloud out of Gods hands; nor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> red with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> bloud; nor <hi>Achitophel</hi> with his own; nor <hi>Judas</hi> with Chriſts, or his own. That that Pilate did illuſorily, God can do truely, waſh his hands from the bloud of any of thoſe men. It were a weak plea to ſay, I killed not that man; but it is true, I commanded one who was under my command, to kill him: It is rather a prevarication, then a juſtification of God, to ſay, God is not the authour of ſinne in any man: but it is true, God makes that mans ſinne, that ſinne. God is innocencie: and the beams that flow from him, are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and colour. Chriſt, when he appeared in heaven, was not red, but white; his hand, his head, and hairs too: he, and that that grows from him; he, and we, as we come from his hands, are white too: his angels, that provoke us to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10526:19"/> imitation of that pattern, are ſo in white; two men, two angels ſtood by the apoſtles in white <note place="margin">Acts 1. 10.</note> apparell: the imitation is laid upon us, by precept too: <hi>At all times let thy garments be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles 9. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>white;</hi> thoſe actions, in which thou appeareſt to the world, innocent. It is true that Chriſt is both; <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy,</hi> ſayes the <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 10.</note> Spouſe: but the white was his own; his redneſſe is from us. That which <hi>Zipporah</hi> ſaid to her husband <hi>Moſes</hi> in anger, the Church may ſay to Chriſt in thankfulneſſe, <hi>Verè ſponſus ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Thou art truely a bloudy husband to me; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim, ſanguinum;</hi> of blouds, blouds in the plurall: for all our blouds are upon him. This was a mercie to the militant Church, that even the triumphant Church wondred at it. They knew not Chriſt, when he came up into heaven in red; <hi>Who is this that cometh in red garments?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>wherefore is thy apparell red, like him that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the wine-preſſe?</hi> They knew he went down in white, in entire innocencie; and they wondred to ſee him return in red: but he ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them; <hi>Calcavi,</hi> You think I have troden the wine-preſſe, and you miſtake it not: <hi>I have tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the wine-preſse:</hi> and <hi>Calcavi ſolus,</hi> and that <hi>alone:</hi> All the redneſſe, all the bloud of the whole world is upon me: and as he addes, <hi>Non vir de gentibus;</hi> Of all people there was none with me; with me ſo, as to have any part in the merit; ſo, of all people there was none with me: without me ſo, as to be excluded by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10526:20"/> me, without their own fault, from the benefit of the merit. This redneſſe he carried up to heaven; for by the bloud of his croſſe came peace, both to the things in heaven, and the <note place="margin">Col. 1. 21.</note> things on earth. For the peccabilitie, that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of ſinning, which is in the nature of the angels of heaven, would break out into ſinne, but for that confirmation, which thoſe angels have received in the bloud of Chriſt. This red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he carried to heaven; and this redneſſe he hath left upon earth, that all we, miſerable clods of earth, might be tempered with his bloud: that in his bloud, exhibited in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; bleſſed Sacrament, our long robes might be made white in the bloud of the Lambe: that, though our ſinnes be robes, habits of long continuance in ſinne; yet, through that redneſſe which our ſinnes have caſt upon him, we might come to participate of that white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that righteouſneſſe, which is his own: <hi>We;</hi> that is, <hi>all we:</hi> for, as to take us in, who are of low condition, and obſcure ſtation, a cloud is made white, by his ſitting upon it; <hi>He ſat upon a white cloud:</hi> ſo, to let the higheſt ſee, that they have no whiteneſſe, but from him, he makes the throne white by ſitting upon it: <hi>He ſat upon a great white throne.</hi> It had been great, if it had not been white: white is the colour of dilatatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Goodneſſe enlarges the throne. It had not been white, if he had not ſat upon it. That goodneſſe onely which conſiſts in glorifying
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10526:20"/> God, and God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of the truth, is true whiteneſſe. God hath no redneſſe in himſelf, no anger towards us, till he conſiders us as ſinners. God caſts no redneſſe upon us, inflicts no neceſſitie, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of ſinning upon us: we have died our ſelves in ſinnes as red as ſcarlet, we have drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves in ſuch a red ſea. But as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was waſhed in the Red ſea, would come out white, <hi>(ſo wonderfull works hath God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>done at the Red ſea,</hi> ſayes David) ſo doth his whiteneſſe work through our red, and makes this <hi>Adam,</hi> this red earth, <hi>Calculum candidum,</hi> that white ſtone, that receives a new name, not <hi>Iſh,</hi> not <hi>Enoſh,</hi> not <hi>Gheber;</hi> no name that taſts of miſerie, nor of vanitie; but that name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and manifeſted, which was imprinted upon us in our elections, the ſonnes of God; the irremoveable, the undiſinheritable ſonnes of God.</p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed to receive this note at parting, that there is <hi>Macula alba,</hi> a ſpot, and yet white, as well as a red ſpot: a whiteneſſe, that is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a leproſie, as well as a redneſſe. It is whole-Pelagianiſme, to think nature alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; half-Pelagianiſme, to think grace once received to be ſufficient; ſuper-Pelagianiſme, to think our actions can bring God in debt to us by merit, and ſupererogation, &amp; Cathariſme, imaginarie puritie, in canonizing our ſelves as preſent ſaints, and condemning all that differ
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10526:21"/> from us, as reprobates. All theſe are white ſpots, and have the colour of goodneſſe; but are indications of leproſie. So is that, that God threatens, <hi>Decorticatio ficûs &amp; albi rami;</hi> that <note place="margin">Joel 1. 7.</note> the fig-tree ſhall be barked, and the boughs thereof left white. To be left white without bark, was an indication of a ſpeedy withering. <hi>Oſtenſa candeſcunt, &amp; areſcunt,</hi> ſayes <hi>S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> of that place: the bough that lies open without bark, looks white, but periſheth. The good works that are done openly to pleaſe men, <hi>have their reward</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) that is, ſhall never have reward. To pretend to do good, and not mean it; to do things good in themſelves, but not to good ends; to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards good ends, but not by good wayes; to make the deceiving of men thine end, or the praiſe of men thine end; all this may have a whiteneſſe, a colour of good: but all this is a barking of the bough, and an indication of a miſchievous leproſie. There is no good white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but a reflexion from Chriſt Jeſus, in an humble acknowledgement that we have none of our own; and in a confident aſſurance, that in our worſt eſtate we may be made partakers of his. We are all red earth. In <hi>Adam,</hi> we would not; ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> we could not avoid ſinne, and the concomitants thereof, miſeries; which we have called our Weſt, our cloud, our darkneſſe. But then we have a North, that ſcatters theſe clouds, in the next word, <hi>Ad</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y fair occaſion from theſe words, we propoſed to you the whole compaſſe of mans voyage, from his launching forth in this world, to his anchoring in the next; from his hoyſing ſail here, to his ſtriking ſail there: in which compaſſe we deſigned to you his foure quarters: firſt, his Eaſt, where he muſt begin, the fundamentall knowledge of the Trinitie (for that we found to be the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication &amp; diſtinctive character of a Chriſtian) where, though that be ſo, we ſhewed you alſo, why we were not called <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> but <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> and we ſhewed you the advantage that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10526:24"/> man hath, in laying hold upon God in theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall notions; That the prodigall ſonne hath an indulgent father; that the decayed father hath an abundant ſonne; that the dejected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath a Spirit of comfort to fly to in heaven. And as we ſhewed you from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that it was an Atheiſme to be no Chriſtian: <hi>(Without God,</hi> ſayes he, as long as without Chriſt) ſo we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the ſlackneſſe of Chriſtians, that they did not ſeriouſly and particularly conſider the perſons of the Trinitie, and eſpecially the holy Ghoſt, in their particular actions: And then we came to that conſideration, whether this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine were eſtabliſhed, or directly inſinuated, in this plurall word of our text, <hi>Faciamus, Let us make man:</hi> and we found that doctrine to be here, and here firſt, of any place in the Bible: and finding God to ſpeak in the plurall, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted (for a time) that interpretation which ſome had made thereof, That God ſpake in the perſon of a Soveraigne Prince, and therefore (as they do) in the plurall, <hi>We:</hi> And thereby having eſtabliſhed reverence to Princes, we claymed, in Gods behalf, the ſame reverence to him; that men would demean themſelves here, when God is ſpoken to in prayer, as reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently as when they ſpeak to the King. But afterwards we found God to ſpeak here not onely as our King, but as our Maker, as God himſelf, and God in councel, <hi>Faciamus:</hi> And we applied thereunto the difference of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10526:24"/> to a perſon of that honourable rank, when we came before him at the councel-table, and when we came to him at his own table; and thereby advanced the ſeriouſneſſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, God in the Trinitie. And farther we ſailed not with our Eaſtern winde. Our Weſt we conſidered in the next word, <hi>Hominem;</hi> That, though we were made by the whole Trinitie, yet the whole Trinitie made us but men, and men in this name of our text, <hi>Adam;</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> is but earth: and that is our Weſt, our declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Sun-ſet. We paſſed over the foure names, by which man is ordinarily expreſſed in the ſcriptures; and we found neceſſary miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in three of them; and poſſible, nay, likely miſerie in the fourth, in the beſt name. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon the name of our text, <hi>Adam,</hi> earth; and had ſome uſe of theſe notes; firſt, That if I were but earth, God was pleaſed to be the potter; If I but a ſheep, he a ſhepherd; If I but a cottage, he a builder: So he work upon me, let me be what he will. We noted, that God made us earth, not aire, not fire; that man hath bodily and worldly duties to perform, and is not all ſpirit in this life. Devotion is his ſoul: but he hath a bodie of diſcretion &amp; uſefulneſſe to inveſt in ſome calling. We noted too, that in being earth we are equall: we tried that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, firſt in the root, in <hi>Adam;</hi> there if any man will be nobler earth then I, he muſt have more originall ſinne then I: for that was all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10526:25"/> patrimonie, all that he could give. And we tried this equalitie in another furnace, in the grave; where there is no means to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh royall from plebeian, nor catholick from hereticall duſt. And laſtly we noted, that this our earth was red; &amp; conſidered in what reſpect it was red, even in Gods hands; but found that in the bloud-redneſſe of ſinne, God had no hand; but ſinne, and deſtructions for ſinne, were wholly from our ſelves: which conſideration we ended with this, that there was <hi>Macula alba,</hi> a white ſpot of leproſie, as well as a red: and we found the overvaluation of our own puritie, and the uncharitable condemnation of all that differ from us, to be that white ſpot. And ſo farre we ſailed with that Weſtern winde, &amp; are come to our third point in this our compaſſe, our North.</p>
                  <p>In this point, the North, we place our firſt <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>III</label> comfort. The North is not alwayes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortableſt <note place="margin">Aquilo.</note> clime; nor is the North alwayes a type of happineſſe in the ſcriptures. Many times God threatens ſtorms from the North: but even in thoſe Northern ſtorms, we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their action, that they ſcatter, they diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thoſe clouds which were gathered, and ſo induce a ſerenitie. And ſo fair weather comes <note place="margin">Job 37. 22.</note> from the North. The conſideration of our Weſt, our low eſtate, that we are but earth, but red earth, died red by our ſelves; and that imaginary white, which appeares ſo to us, is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10526:25"/> but a white of leproſie: this Weſt inwraps us in heavie clouds of murmuring in this life, that we cannot live ſo freely as beaſts do; and in clouds of deſperation for the next life, that we cannot die ſo abſolutely as beaſts do. We die all our lives; and yet we live after our deaths: Theſe are our clouds; &amp; then the North ſhakes theſe clouds. <hi>The North-winde driveth away the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>rain,</hi> ſayes <hi>Solomon.</hi> There is a North in our text, that drives all theſe tears from our eyes. Chriſt calls upon the North as well as the <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 16.</note> South, to blow upon his garden, and to diffuſe the perfumes thereof. Adverſitie, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, opens the bountie of God unto us; and oftentimes better. But that is not the benefit of the North, in our preſent conſideration: but this is it, that firſt our Sunne ſets in the Weſt. The Eaſtern dignitie which we received in our firſt creation, as we were the work of the whole Trinitie, falls under a Weſtern cloud, that that Trinitie made us but earth. And then blows our North, and ſcatters this cloud; that this earth hath a nobler form then any other part or limbe of the world: for we are made by a fairer pattern, by a nobler image, by a higher likeneſſe. <hi>Faciamus;</hi> Though we make but a man, <hi>Let us make</hi> him <hi>in our image, after our likeneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The varietie which the holy Ghoſt uſes here in the pen of <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath given occaſion to divers, to raiſe divers obſervations upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10526:26"/> theſe words, which ſeem divers, <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſſe;</hi> as alſo in the varietie of the phraſe: for it is thus conceived and layed, <hi>In our image;</hi> and then, <hi>After our likeneſſe.</hi> I know it is a good rule that <hi>Damaſcen</hi> gives, <hi>Parva non ſunt parva, ex quibus magna proveniunt; Nothing is to be neglected, as little, from which great things may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe:</hi> If the conſequence may be great, the thing muſt not be thought little. No <hi>Jod</hi> in the ſcripture ſhall periſh; therefore no <hi>Jod</hi> is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: if it were ſuperfluous, it might pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Words, and leſſe particles then words, have buſied the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>In the Councel of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where Biſhops in a great number excommunicated Biſhops in a greater; Biſhop againſt Biſhop, and Patriarch againſt Patriarch; in which caſe, when both parties had made ſtrong parties in Court, and the Emperour forbore to declare himſelf on either ſide for a time, he was told, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to aſſent to that which 6000 Biſhops had agreed in: the ſtrife was but for a word, whether the bleſſed Virgin might be called <hi>Deipara, The mother of God,</hi> for <hi>Chriſtipara, The mother of Chriſt;</hi> which Chriſt all agree to be God. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and all his partie agreed with <hi>Cyril,</hi> that ſhe might be. In the Councel of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> the difference was not ſo great, as for a word compoſed of ſyllables. It was but for a ſyllable, whether <hi>Ex</hi> or <hi>In.</hi> The heretiques condemned then, confeſſed Chriſt to be <hi>Ex du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:10526:26"/> 
                     <hi>naturis,</hi> to be <hi>compoſed of two natures,</hi> at firſt; but not to be <hi>In duabus naturis,</hi> not to <hi>conſiſt of two natures</hi> after. And for that <hi>In,</hi> they were thruſt out. In the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> it was not ſo much as a ſyllable made of letters; for it was but for one letter; whether <hi>Homoouſion,</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uſion,</hi> was the iſſue. Where the queſtion hath not been of divers words, nor ſyllables, nor letters, but onely of the place of words, what tempeſtuous differences have riſen! How much hath <hi>ſola fides</hi> and <hi>fides ſola</hi> changed the caſe! Nay, where there hath been no quarrell for precedencie, for tranſpoſing of words, or ſyllables, or letters, where there hath not been ſo much as a letter in queſtion, how much doth an accent varie a ſenſe! An interrogation or no interrogation, will make it directly contrarie. All Chriſtian expoſitours reade thoſe words of <hi>Cain, My ſinne is greater then can be pardoned,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note> poſitively; and ſo they are evident words of <hi>deſperation.</hi> The Jews reade them with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation, <hi>Are my ſinnes greater then can be pardoned?</hi> and ſo they are words of <hi>compunction</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> The prophet <hi>Micheas</hi> ſayes, that <note place="margin">Mich. 5. 3.</note> Bethlehem is a ſmall place: The Evangeliſt S. <note place="margin">Matth. 2. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayes, No ſmall place. An interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Micheas</hi> mouth reconciles it; <hi>Art thou a ſmall place?</hi> amounts to that, <hi>Thou art not.</hi> Sounds, voices, words, muſt not be neglected: for Chriſts forerunner, <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> qualified himſelf no otherwiſe; he was but a <hi>voice:</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10526:27"/> Chriſt himſelf is <hi>Verbum; The Word</hi> is the name even of the Sonne of God. No doubt but States-men &amp; Magiſtrates finde often the danger of having ſuffered ſmall abuſes to paſſe uncorrected. We that ſee State-buſineſſe but in the glaſſe of ſtorie, and cannot be ſhut out of chronicles, ſee there, upon what little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the eye and the jealouſie of the State is oftentimes forced to bend it ſelf. We know in whoſe times in Rome a man might not weep, he might not ſigh, he might not look pale, he might not be ſick, but it was informed againſt, as a diſcontent, as a murmuring againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government, and an inclination to change. And truely many times, upon <hi>Damaſcens</hi> true ground, though not alwayes well applied, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va non ſunt parva;</hi> Nothing may be thought little, when the conſequence may prove great. In our own ſphere, in the Church, we are ſure it is ſo; great inconveniences grew upon ſmall tolerations. Therefore in that buſineſſe, which occaſioned all that trouble which we mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, in the Councel of Epheſus, when S. <hi>Cyril</hi> wrote to the Clergie of his dioceſſe about it, at firſt he ſayes, <hi>Praeſtiterat abſtinere, It had been better theſe queſtions had not been raiſed:</hi> but (ſayes he) <hi>Si his nugis nos adoriantur, If they vex us with theſe impertinences, theſe trifles:</hi> And yet theſe, which were but trifles at firſt, came to occaſion Councels; and then to divide Councel againſt Councel; and then to force the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10526:27"/> to take away the power of both Councels, and govern in Councel by his <hi>Vicar generall,</hi> a ſecular Lord ſent from Court. And therefore did ſome of the Ancients (particularly <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrius)</hi> crie down ſome opinions for hereſies, which were not matters of faith, but of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie; and even in philoſophie truely held by them who were condemned for hereticks, and miſtaken by their Judges that condemned them. Little things were called in queſtion, leſt great things ſhould paſſe unqueſtioned: and ſome of theſe upon <hi>Damaſcens</hi> true ground (ſtill true in rule, but not alwayes in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) <hi>Parva non ſunt parva;</hi> Nothing may be thought little, where the conſequence may prove great. Deſcend we from thoſe great ſpheres, the State and the Church, into a leſſer, that is, the conſcience of particular men, and conſider the danger of expoſing thoſe <hi>vines</hi> to <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 15.</note> little <hi>foxes;</hi> of leaving ſmall ſinnes unconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, unrepented, uncorrected. In that gliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circle in the firmament, which we call the <hi>Galaxie,</hi> the milkie-way, there is not one ſtarre of any of the ſix great magnitudes, which Aſtronomers proceed upon, belonging to that circle: it is a glorious circle, and poſſeſſeth a great part of heaven; and yet is all of ſo little ſtarres as have no name, no knowledge taken of them: So certainly are there many Saints in heaven, that ſhine as ſtarres, and yet are not of thoſe great magnitudes, to have been <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:10526:28"/> or <hi>Prophets,</hi> or <hi>Apostles,</hi> or <hi>Martyrs,</hi> or <hi>Doctours,</hi> or <hi>Virgins;</hi> but good &amp; bleſſed ſouls, that have religiouſly performed the duties of inferiour callings, and no more. And as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are there many ſouls tormented in hell, that never ſinned ſinne of any of the great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, <hi>Idolatry, Adultery, Murder,</hi> or the like; but inconſiderately have ſlid, and inſenſibly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the practiſe and habit of leſſer ſinnes. But <hi>parva non ſunt parva;</hi> Nothing may be thought little, where the conſequence may prove great. When our Saviour ſayes, <hi>That we</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall give an account for every idle word in the day of judgement,</hi> what great hills of little ſands will oppreſſe us then! And if ſubſtances of ſinne were removed, yet what circumſtances of ſinne would condemne us! If idle words have this weight, there can be no word thought idle in the Scriptures: And therefore I blame not in any, I decline not in mine own practiſe, the making uſe of the varietie and copiouſneſſe of the holy Ghoſt, who is ever abundant, and yet never ſuperfluous in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his purpoſe in change of words. And ſo no doubt we might do now in obſerving a difference between theſe words in our text, <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Likeneſſe;</hi> and between theſe two forms of expreſſing it, <hi>In our image,</hi> and, <hi>After our likeneſſe.</hi> This might be done. But that that muſt be done, will poſſeſſe all our time; that is, to declare (taking the two for this time to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10526:28"/> but a farther illuſtration of one another; <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſſe,</hi> to our preſent purpoſe, to be all one) what this <hi>image</hi> and this <hi>likeneſſe</hi> imports; and how this North ſcatters our former cloud; what our advantage is, that we are made to an image, to a pattern; and our obligation to ſet a pattern before us in all our actions.</p>
                  <p>God appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> to make all that he made, by a pattern. God himſelf made all that he made, according to a pattern. God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited and laid up in himſelf certain forms, patterns, <hi>Ideas</hi> of every thing that he made. He made nothing, of which he had not precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the form, and predetermined in himſelf, I will make it thus. And when he had made any thing, he ſaw it was good; Good, becauſe it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the pattern, the image; Good, becauſe it was like to that. And therefore though of other creatures God pronounced they were good, becauſe they were preſently like their pattern, that is, like that form which was in him for them: yet of man, he forbore to ſay that he was good; becauſe his conformitie to his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern was to appeare after in his ſubſequent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now as God made man after another pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and therefore we have a dignitie above all, that we had another manner of creation then the reſt: ſo have we a comfort above all, that we have another manner of adminiſtration then the reſt. God exerciſes another manner of providence upon man, then upon other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10526:29"/> creatures. <hi>A ſparrow falls not without God,</hi> ſayes <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 29.</note> Chriſt: yet no doubt God works otherwiſe in the fall of eminent perſons, then in the fall of ſparrows; <hi>for ye are of more value then many ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> ſayes Chriſt there of every man: &amp; ſome men ſingle, are of more value then many men. God doth not thank the ant, for her induſtrie and good husbandrie in providing for her ſelf. God doth not reward the foxes, for concurring <note place="margin">Judg. 15. 4.</note> with <hi>Samſon</hi> in his revenge. God doth not fee the lion, which was his executioner upon the <note place="margin">1. King. 13. 24</note> Prophet which had diſobeyed his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor thoſe few ſhe-bears, which ſlew <note place="margin">2. King. 2. 24.</note> the petulant children who had calumniated and reproached <hi>Eliſha.</hi> God doth not fee them before, nor thank them after, nor take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their ſervice: But for thoſe men that ſerved Gods execution upon the idolaters of <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 25.</note> the golden calf, it is pronounced in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that therein they conſecrated themſelves unto God; and for that ſervice God made that Tribe, the Tribe of Levi, his portion, his cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, his conſecrated Tribe: So, <hi>Quia feciſti hoc,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 16.</note> ſayes God to Abraham, <hi>By my ſelf I have ſworn, becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held thy ſonne, thine onely ſonne: that in bleſsing I will bleſſe thee, and in multiplying I will multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thee.</hi> So neither is God angrie with the dog <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 22.</note> that turns to his vomit; nor with the ſow, that after her waſhing wallows in the mire. But of man in that caſe he ſayes, <hi>It is impoſsible for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 4.</note>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:10526:29"/> 
                     <hi>thoſe who were once enlightned, if they fall away, to renew themſelves again by repentance.</hi> The creatures live under his law, but a law impoſed thus, This they ſhall do, this they muſt do: Man lives under another manner of law, This you ſhall do, that is, This you ſhould do, This I would have you do. And, <hi>Fac hoc, Do this, and you ſhall live;</hi> diſobey, and you ſhall die: but yet the choice is yours; chooſe you this day life or death. So that this is Gods adminiſtration in the creature, that he hath imprinted in them an inſtinct, and ſo he hath ſomething to preſerve in them: In man, his adminiſtration is this, that he hath imprinted in him a facultie of will and election, and hath ſomething to reward in him. That inſtinct in the creature God leaves to the naturall working thereof in it ſelf: but the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of man God viſits &amp; aſſiſts with his grace, to do ſupernaturall things. When the creature doth an extraordinarie action above the nature thereof (as when Balaams aſſe ſpake) the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exerciſes no facultie, no will in it ſelf; but God forced it to that it did. When man doth any thing conducing to ſupernaturall ends, though the work be Gods, the will of man is not meerly paſſive. The will of man is but Gods agent; but ſtill an agent it is, and an agent in another manner then the tongue of the beaſt. For the will conſidered as a will (and grace never deſtroyes nature; nor, though it make a dead will a live will, or an ill will a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10526:30"/> good will, doth it make the will no will) might refuſe or omit that it does. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are created by another pattern, we are governed by another law, and another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>Go thou then the ſame way. If God wrought by a pattern, and writ by a copie, and proceeded by a precedent; do thou ſo too. Never ſay, There is no Church without errour; therefore I will be bound by none, but frame a Church of mine own, or be a Church to my ſelf. What greater injuſtice then to propoſe no image, no pattern to thy ſelf to imitate; and yet propoſe thy ſelf for a pattern, for an image to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Thou wilt have ſingular opinions, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular wayes, differing from all other men: and yet all that are not of thy opinion, muſt be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and all reprobates, that go not thy wayes. Propoſe good patterns to thy ſelf, and thereby become a fit pattern for others. God (we ſee) was the firſt that made images; and he was the firſt that forbad them: he made them for imitation; he forbad them, in danger of adoration. For, what a baſeneſſe, what a madneſſe of the ſoul is it, to worſhip that which is no better, nay, not ſo good as it ſelf! Worſhip belongs to the beſt: know then thy diſtance and thy period, how farre to go, and where to ſtop. Diſhonour not God by an image, in worſhipping it; and yet benefit thy ſelf by it in following it: There
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10526:30"/> is no more danger out of a picture, then out of a hiſtorie, if thou intend no more in either then example. Though thou have a Weſt, a dark and a ſad condition, that thou art but earth, a man of infirmities, and ill-counſelled in thy ſelf: yet thou haſt here a North, that ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and diſpells theſe clouds, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to thee in his Scriptures; and otherwiſe, images, patterns of good and holy men to go by. But beyond this North, this aſſiſtance of good examples of men, thou haſt a South, a Meridionall height, by which thou ſeeſt thine image, thy pattern, to be no copie, no other man, but the originall it ſelf, God himſelf: <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciamus ad noſtram; Let us make man in our image, after our likeneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we conſider firſt, where the image is; <label type="milestone">

And as when we ſeek God in his eſſence, we are adviſed to proceed by <hi>negatives</hi> (God is <hi>not mortall, not paſsible:)</hi> ſo when we ſeek the image of God in man, we begin with a <hi>negative,</hi> This image is not his <hi>Bodie. Tertullian</hi> declined to think it was; nay, <hi>Tertullian</hi> inclined others to think ſo; for he is the firſt that is noted to have been the authour of that opinion that God had a bodie: yet S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> excuſes <hi>Tertullian</hi> for hereſie: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>Tertullian might</hi>

I would S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie might prevail with them that pretend to be <hi>Auguſtinianiſsimi,</hi> and to adore him ſo much in the Romane Church, not to caſt the name of <hi>Hereſie</hi> upon every probleme, nor the name of <hi>Heretick</hi> upon every inquirer of truth. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would deliver <hi>Tertullian</hi> from here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, in a point concerning God; and they will condemne us of hereſie, in every point that may be drawn to concern, not the <hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> not their <hi>doctrine,</hi> but their <hi>profit. Malo de miſericordia Deo rationem redde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, quàm de crudelitate; I ſhall better anſwer God for my mildeneſſe, then for my ſeveritie.</hi> And though anger towards a brother, or a <hi>Racha,</hi> or a <hi>Fool,</hi> will bear an action; yet he ſhall recover leſſe againſt me at that barre, whom I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>weak,</hi> or <hi>miſſe-led</hi> (as I muſt neceſſarily call many in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church) then he whom I have paſſionately and peremptorily called <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick:</hi> for I dare call an opinion <hi>hereſie</hi> for the matter, a great while before I dare call the man that holds it an <hi>heretick:</hi> for that conſiſts much in the manner. It muſt be matter of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter be hereſie; but there muſt be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10526:31"/> pertinacie after convenient inſtruction, before the man be an heretick. But how excuſable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Tertullian</hi> be herein, in S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, there was a whole ſect of hereticks an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the <hi>Audiani,</hi> who over literally taking thoſe places of Scripture, where God is ſaid to have hands, and feet, and eyes, and eares, beleeved God to have a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die like ours; and accordingly interpreted this text, that in that image, and that likeneſſe, a bodily likeneſſe, conſiſted this image of God in man. And yet even theſe men, theſe <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Epiphanius</hi> (who firſt took knowledge of them) calls but <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> not <hi>hereticks:</hi> ſo loth is charitie to ſay the worſt of any. Yet we muſt remember them of the <hi>Romane</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they come too neare giving God a bodie in their <hi>pictures</hi> of God the Father: and they bring the bodie of God, that bodie which God the Sonne hath aſſumed, the bodie of Chriſt, too neare in their <hi>Tranſſubſtantiation:</hi> not too neare our faith (for ſo it cannot be brought too neare to our ſenſe, ſo it is as really there as we are there) not too neare in the <hi>ubi;</hi> for ſo it is there, there, that is, in that place to which the Sacrament extends it ſelf: for the Sacrament extends as well to heaven, from whence it fetches grace, as to the table from whence it delivers bread and wine: but too neare in <hi>modo;</hi> for it comes not thither that way. We muſt neceſſarily complain, that they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10526:32"/> make religion too bodily a thing. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt corrected <hi>Marie Magdalenes</hi> zeal, where ſhe flew to him in a perſonall devotion; and ſaid, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                     <hi>to my Father.</hi> Fix your meditations upon Chriſt Jeſus, ſo as he is now at the right hand of his Father in heaven, and entangle not your ſelves ſo with controverſies about his bodie, as to loſe <hi>reall charitie</hi> for <hi>imaginarie zeal;</hi> nor enlarge your ſelves ſo farre in the pictures and images of his bodie, as to worſhip them more then him. As <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayes of God, that he is <hi>Superprincipale principium, A beginning before any beginning we can conceive;</hi> and <hi>praeterea aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas, an eternitie infinitely elder then any eternity we can imagine:</hi> ſo he is <hi>ſuperſpiritualis Spiritus,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Superſpirit,</hi> as that the ſoul of man, and the ſubſtance of angels, is but a bodie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this Spirit. God hath no bodie, though <hi>Tertullian</hi> diſputed it, though the <hi>Audians</hi> preached it, though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> paint it: and therefore this image of God is not in the body of man that way.</p>
                  <p>Nor that way neither which ſome others have aſſigned, That God, who hath no bodie as God, yet in the creation did aſſume that form which man hath now, and ſo made man in his image, that is, in that form which he had then aſſumed. Some of the ancients thought ſo; and ſome other men of great eſtimation in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Church have thought ſo too. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10526:32"/> 
                     <hi>Oleaſter,</hi> a great officer in the Inquiſition of <hi>Spain.</hi> But great inquirers into other men, are eaſie neglecters of themſelves. The image of God is not in mans bodie this way.</p>
                  <p>Nor that third way which others have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that is, that when God ſaid, <hi>Let us make man after our likeneſſe,</hi> God had reſpect to that form, which in the fulneſſe of time his Sonne was to take upon him upon earth. Let us make him now (ſayes God) at firſt, like that which I intend hereafter my Sonne ſhall be: for though this were ſpoken before the fall of man, and ſo before any occaſion of decreeing the ſending of Chriſt; yet in the School a great part of great men adhere to that opinion, That God from all eternitie had a purpoſe, that his Sonne ſhould become man in this world, though A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had not fallen; <hi>Non ut medicus, ſed ut Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, ad nobilitandum genus humanum,</hi> ſay they: Though Chriſt had not come as a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> if man had not needed him by ſinne, but had kept his firſt ſtate; yet as a <hi>Prince,</hi> that deſired to heap honour upon him whom he loves, to do man an honour by his aſſuming that nature, Chriſt (ſay they) ſhould have come: and to that image, that form which he was to take then, was man made in this text, ſay theſe imaginers. But (alas!) how much better were wit and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſtowed, to prove to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that a Chriſt muſt come (that they beleeve not) to prove to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Chriſt is come (that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10526:33"/> they beleeve not) to prove to our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that the ſame Chriſt may come again this minute to judgement (we live as though we beleeved not that) then to have filled the world, and torn the Church with frivolous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, Whether Chriſt ſhould have come if Adam had not fallen! Wo unto fomentours of frivolous diſputations. None of theſe wayes: not becauſe God hath a bodie, not becauſe God aſſumed a bodie; not becauſe it was intended that Chriſt ſhould be born, before it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that man ſhould be made, is this image of God in the bodie of man: nor hath it in any other relation reſpect to the bodie; but, as we ſay in the School, <hi>arguitivè,</hi> and <hi>ſignificativé;</hi> that becauſe God hath given man a bodie of a nobler form then any other creature, we inferre, and argue, and conclude from thence, that God is otherwiſe repreſented in man then in any other creature: and ſo farre is this image of God in the bodie above that in the creatures, that as you ſee ſome pictures, to which the very tables are jewels; ſome watches, to which the very caſes are jewels; and therefore they have outward caſes too; and ſo the picture and the watch are in that outward caſe, of what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtuff ſoever that be: ſo is this image in this bodie, as in an outward caſe, ſo as that you may not injure nor enfeeble this bodie, neither by ſinfull intemperance and licentiouſneſſe, nor by inordinate faſtings or other diſciplines of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10526:33"/> imaginarie merits, while the bodie is alive; for the image of God is in it: nor defraud the body of decent buriall and due ſolemnities after death; for the image of God is to return to it. But yet the bodie is but the outward caſe, and God looks not for the gilding, or enamelling, or painting of that; but requires the labour and coſt therein to be beſtowed upon the table it ſelf, in which this image is immediately, that is, the ſoul: and that is truely the <hi>ubi,</hi> the place where this image is. And there remains onely now the operation thereof, how this image of God in the ſoul of man works.</p>
                  <p>The ſphere then of this Intelligence, the gallerie for this picture, the arch for this ſtatue, the table and frame and ſhrine for this image of God, is inwardly and immediately the ſoul of man: not <hi>immediately</hi> ſo, as that the ſoul of man is a part of the eſſence of God; for ſo <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially</hi> Chriſt onely is the image of God. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at firſt thought ſo; <hi>Putabam te, Deus, corpus lucidum, &amp; me fruſtum de illo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore: I took thee, O God</hi> (ſayes that Father) <hi>to be a globe of fire, and my ſoul to be a ſpark of that fire; thee to be a bodie of light, and my ſoul to be a beam of that light.</hi> But S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth not onely retract that in himſelf, but diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in the <hi>Manichees.</hi> But this image is in our ſoul, as the <hi>ſoul</hi> is the <hi>wax,</hi> and this <hi>image</hi> the <hi>ſeal.</hi> The compariſon is S. <hi>Cyrils;</hi> and he addes well, that no ſeal but that which printed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10526:34"/> the wax at firſt, can fit that wax, and fill that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion after: no image, but the image of God, can fit our ſoul; every other ſeal is too narrow, too ſhallow for it. The magiſtrate is ſealed with the <hi>Lion;</hi> the <hi>Wolf</hi> will not fit that ſeal: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath a <hi>power</hi> in his hand, but not <hi>oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Princes are ſealed with the <hi>Crown;</hi> the <hi>Mitre</hi> will not fit that ſeal. Powerfully and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly they protect the Church, and are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream heads of the Church; but they miniſter not the Sacraments of the Church: they give preferments, but they give not the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of preferments: they give order who ſhall have, but they have not Orders by which they are enabled to have that they have. Men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour and laborious callings in the world are ſealed with the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> a <hi>Roſe,</hi> or a <hi>bunch of Grapes</hi> will not anſwer that ſeal: eaſe and plentie in age muſt not be looked for without croſſes, and labour, and induſtrie in youth. All men, Prince and people, Clergie and Magiſtrate, are ſealed with the image of God, with a conformitie to him; and worldly ſeals will not anſwer that, nor fill up that ſeal. We ſhould wonder to ſee a mother in the midſt of many ſweet children, paſſing her time in making babies and puppets for her own delight. We ſhould wonder to ſee a man, whoſe chambers and galleries were full of curious maſter-pieces, thruſt in a village-fayre, to look upon ſixpenie pictures &amp; three-farthing prints. We have all the image of God
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10526:34"/> at home; and we all make babies, fancies of honour in our ambitions. The maſter-piece is our own, in our own boſome; and we thruſt in countrey-fayres, that is, we endure the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of any unſeaſonable weather, in night-journeys and watchings; we endure the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſcorns, and triumphs of a rivall and competitour, that ſeeks with us, and ſhares with us. We endure the guiltineſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of having deceived the truſt which a confident friend repoſes in us, and ſolicite his wife or daughter. We endure the decay of fortune, of bodie, of ſoul, of honour, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe lovers pictures; pictures that are not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, not made by that hand of God, Nature; but artificiall beauties: and for that bodie we give a ſoul; and for that drug which might have been bought where they bought it, for a ſhilling, we give an eſtate. The image of God is more worth then all ſubſtances; and we give it for colours, for dreams, for ſhadows.</p>
                  <p>But the better to prevent the loſſe, let us conſider the having of this image; in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in what operation this image is in our ſoul: for whether this image be in thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we have in <hi>Nature;</hi> or in thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which we have in <hi>Grace;</hi> or in thoſe ſuper-illuſtrations, which the bleſſed ſhall have in <hi>Glorie,</hi> hath exerciſed the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many. Properly this image is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in the naturall reaſon, and other faculties
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10526:35"/> of the immortall ſoul of man; for thereupon doth S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay, <hi>Imago Dei uri poteſt in gehenna, non exuri;</hi> till the ſoul be burnt to aſhes, to nothing (which cannot be done, no not in hell) the image of God cannot be burnt out of the ſoul; for it is radically, primarily in the very ſoul it ſelf: and whether that ſoul be infuſed into the elect, or reprobate, that image is in that ſoul: as farre as he hath a ſoul by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he hath the image of God by nature in it. But then the ſeal is deeper cut, or harder preſſed, or better preſerved in ſome then in others, and in ſome other conſiderations then meerly naturall: therefore we may conſider man, who was made here to the image of God, and of God in three perſons, to have been made ſo in Gods intendment three wayes: Man had this image in <hi>Nature,</hi> and doth deface it; he hath it alſo in <hi>Grace</hi> here, and ſo doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it; and he ſhall have it in <hi>Glorie</hi> hereafter, and that ſhall fix it, eſtabliſh it. And in every of theſe three, in this Trinitie in man, Nature, Grace, and Glorie, man hath not onely the image of God, but the image of all the perſons of the Trinitie, in every of his three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. He hath the image of the Father, the image of the Sonne, the image of the holy Ghoſt, in nature; and all theſe alſo in grace; and all theſe in glorie too. How all theſe are in all, I cannot hope to handle particularly, not though I were upon the firſt grain of our ſand,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10526:35"/> upon the firſt dram of your patience, upon the firſt flaſh of my ſtrength: But a cleare repeating of theſe many branches, that theſe things are thus, that all the perſons of the heavenly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie are (in their image) in every branch of this humane Trinitie in man, may (at leaſt muſt) ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>In nature then, man, that is, the ſoul of man, hath this image of God; of God, conſidered in his unitie, entirely, altogether in this, that this ſoul is made of nothing, proceeds of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. All other creatures are made of that preexiſtent matter which God had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo were our bodies too, but our ſouls of nothing: now not to be made at all, is to be God himſelf; onely God himſelf was never made. But to be made of nothing, to have no other parent but God, no other element but the breath of God, no other inſtrument but the purpoſe of God, this is to be the image of God; for this is neareſt to God himſelf (who was never made at all) to be made of nothing. And then man (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nature) is otherwiſe the neareſt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God too: for the ſteps which we conſider, are foure; Firſt, <hi>Eſſe, Being;</hi> for ſome things have onely a being, and no life, as ſtones: Secondly, <hi>Vivere, Living;</hi> for ſome things have life, and no ſenſe, as plants: and then thirdly, <hi>Sentire, Senſe;</hi> for ſome things have ſenſe, and no underſtanding; which underſtanding and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10526:36"/> reaſon man hath with his being, and life, and ſenſe; and ſo is in a nearer ſtation to God, then any creature, and a livelier image of him (who is the root of being) then all they; becauſe man onely hath all the declarations of beings. Nay, if we conſider Gods eternitie, the ſoul of man hath ſuch an image of that, as that, though man had a beginning, which the originall, the eternall God himſelf had not; yet man ſhall no more have an end, then the originall, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God himſelf ſhall have. And this image of eternitie, this poſt-meridian, this after-noon eternitie, that is, this perpetuitie and after-ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſſe is in man, meerly as a naturall man, without any conſideration of grace: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate can no more die, that is, come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then the elect. It is but of the naturall man that <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſayes, <hi>A King built a citie, and erected his ſtatue in the middest of that citie;</hi> that is, God made man, and imprinted his image in his ſoul. <hi>How will this King take it</hi> (ſayes that Father) <hi>to have this ſtatue thrown down?</hi> Every man doth ſo, if he do not exalt his naturall faculties, if he do not hearken to the law written in his heart, if he do not run, as <hi>Plato,</hi> or as <hi>Socrates,</hi> in the wayes of vertuous actions; he throws down the ſtatue of this King, he defaces the image of God. <hi>How would this King take it</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>if any other ſtatue, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſtatue of his enemie ſhould be ſet up in his place?</hi> Every man doth ſo too, that embraces
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10526:36"/> falſe opinions in matter of doctrine, or falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of happineſſe in matter of converſation; for theſe a naturall man may avoid in many caſes, without that addition of Grace which is offered to us as Chriſtians. That compariſon of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to man, which is intimated in Job, is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but of the naturall man. There ſpeaking of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth, that is, of the greateſt of creatures, he ſayes in our Tranſlation that <hi>He is the chief of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 40. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>the wayes of God:</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi> hath it, <hi>Principium;</hi> and others before him, <hi>Initium viarum Dei;</hi> that when God went the progreſſe over the world in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation thereof, he did but begin, he did but ſet out at Behemoth, at the beſt of all ſuch creatures; <hi>He.</hi> All they were but <hi>Initium viarum, The beginning of the wayes of God:</hi> but, <hi>Finis viarum, the end of his journey,</hi> and the eve, the veſpers of his Sabbath, was the making of man, even of the naturall man. Behemoth and the other creatures were <hi>veſtigia,</hi> ſayes the School. In them we may ſee where God hath gone; for all being is from God: and ſo every thing that hath a being, hath <hi>filiationem veſtigii,</hi> a teſtimonie of Gods having paſſed that way, and called in there: but man hath <hi>filiationem imaginis,</hi> an expreſſion of his image; and doth the office of an image or picture, to bring him whom it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, the more lively to our memories. Gods abridgement of the whole world was man; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abridge man into his leaſt volume, <hi>in pura natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> as he is but meer man, and ſo he hath the image of God in his ſoul.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:10526:37"/>
                  <p> He hath it as God is conſidered in his unitie; for as God is, the ſoul of man is, indiviſibly, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly, one entire. And he hath it alſo as God is notified to us in a Trinitie: for as there are three perſons in the eſſence of God; ſo are there three faculties in the ſoul of man. The attributes, and ſome kinde of ſpeculation of the perſons in the Trinitie, are, power to the Father, wiſdome to the Sonne, and goodneſſe to the holy Ghoſt. And the three faculties of the ſoul have the images of theſe three: the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> is the image of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that is, <hi>Power;</hi> for no man exerciſes power, no man can govern well, without underſtanding the natures &amp; diſpoſitions of them whom he governs: and therefore in this conſiſts the power which man hath over the creature, that man underſtands the nature of every creature; for ſo Adam did when he named every creature according to the nature thereof: and by this advantage of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them, and comprehending them, we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter them; and ſo, <hi>Obliviſcuntur quod natae ſunt,</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> the lion, the bear, the elephant, have forgot what they were born to; <hi>Induuntur quod ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentur,</hi> they inveſt and put on ſuch a diſpoſition and ſuch a nature as we enjoyn them &amp; appoint them: <hi>Serviunt ut famuli</hi> (as that Father purſues it ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly) and, <hi>Verberantur ut timidi;</hi> they wait upon us as ſervants, who, if they underſtood us, as well as we underſtand them, might be our maſters; and they receive correction from us, as though they were afraid of us, when, if they underſtood us,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10526:37"/> they would know that we were not able to ſtand in the teeth of the lion, the horn of the bull, in the heels of the horſe; and, <hi>Adjuvantur ut infirmi,</hi> they counterfeit a weakneſſe, that they might be beholding to us for help; and they are content to thank us, if we afford them reſt, or any food, who, if they underſtood us as well as we do them, might tear our meat out of our throats; nay, tear out our throats for their meat. So then in this firſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall facultie of the ſoul, the <hi>

                  <p>And in the ſecond facultie, which is the <hi>Will,</hi> is the image, the attribute of the ſecond perſon, the <hi>Sonne,</hi> which is <hi>Wiſdome:</hi> for wiſdome is not ſo much in knowing, in underſtanding, as in electing, in chooſing, in aſſenting. No man needs go out of himſelf, nor beyond his own legend, and the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his own actions for examples of that, That many times we know better, and chooſe ill wayes. Wiſdome is in chooſing or aſſenting.</p>
                  <p>And then in the third facultie of the ſoul, the <hi>Memorie,</hi> is the image of the third perſon, the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is, <hi>Goodneſſe.</hi> For to remember, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect our former underſtanding, and our former aſſenting, ſo farre as to do them, to crown them with action, that is true goodneſſe. The office that Chriſt aſſignes to the holy Ghoſt, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he promiſeth in his behalf is this, that he ſhall bring former things to our remembrance. <note place="margin">John 14. 26.</note> The wiſe man places all goodneſſe in this facultie, the Memorie: properly nothing can fall into the

Certainly (beloved) if a man were like the King but in countenance, and in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he himſelf would think ſomewhat better of himſelf, and others would be the leſſe apt to put ſcorns or injuries upon him, then if he had a vulgar and courſe aſpect: with thoſe who have the image of the Kings <hi>power</hi> (the <hi>Magiſtrate)</hi> the image of his <hi>wiſdome</hi> (the <hi>Councel)</hi> the image of his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> (the <hi>Clergie)</hi> it ſhould be ſo too; there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to the image of the King in all that have it. Now in all theſe reſpects, man, the meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, hath the image of the King of kings; and therefore reſpect that image in thy ſelf, and exalt thy naturall faculties, emulate thoſe men, and be aſhamed to be outgone by thoſe men who had no light but nature. Make thine underſtanding, and thy will, and thy memorie (though but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faculties) ſerviceable to thy God, and auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie &amp; ſubſidiarie for thy ſalvation: for though they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10526:38"/> be not naturally inſtruments of grace, yet natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ſuſceptible of grace, and have ſo much in their nature, as that by grace they may be made inſtruments of grace, which no facultie in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but man can be. And do not think that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a naturall man cannot do all, he hath nothing to do for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This then is the image of God in man, the firſt way, in <hi>Nature;</hi> and moſt literally this is the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the text. Man was this image thus; and the room furniſhed with this image, was paradiſe: but there is a better room then that paradiſe for the ſecond image (the image of God in man by <hi>Grace)</hi> that is, the Chriſtian Church: for though for the moſt part this text be underſtood <hi>de natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus,</hi> of our naturall faculties; yet <hi>Origen,</hi> and not onely ſuch allegoricall expoſitours, but Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Niſſen,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and others, who are literall enough, aſſigne this image of God to conſiſt in the gifts of Gods grace, exhibited to us here in the Church. A Chriſtian then in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond capacitie, as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and not onely as a <hi>Man,</hi> hath this image of God, of God firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered entirely. And thoſe expreſſions of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, thoſe repreſentations of this image of God in a Chriſtian by grace, which the Apoſtles have exhibited to us, that we are <hi>the ſonnes of God, the ſeed of God, the off-ſpring of God,</hi> and <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> (which are high and glorious exaltations) are enlarged and exalted by <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcen</hi> to a further height, when he ſayes, <hi>Sicut Deus</hi>

So a Chriſtian is made the image of God entirely. To which expreſſion S. <hi>Cyril</hi> alſo comes neare, when he calls a Chriſtian <hi>Deiformem hominem, man in the form of God;</hi> which is a myſterious and a bleſſed metamorphoſis and transfiguration: that, whereas it was the greateſt treſpaſſe of the greateſt treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in the world, the devil, to ſay, <hi>Similis ero Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſsimis,</hi>

                     <hi>I will be like the Higheſt;</hi> it would be as great a treſpaſſe in me not to be like the Higheſt, not to conform my ſelf to God, by the uſe of his grace in the Chriſtian Church. And whereas the humiliation of my Saviour is in all things to be imitated by me, yet herein I am bound to depart from his humiliation; that, whereas he being in the <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6, 7.</note> form of God, took the form of a ſervant; I, being in the form of a ſervant, may (nay, muſt) take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me the form of God, in being <hi>Deiformis homo,</hi> a man made in Chriſt, the image of God. So have I the image of God entirely in his unitie, becauſe I profeſſe that faith which is but one faith, and <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 5.</note> under the ſeal of that Baptiſme which is but one Baptiſme. And then, as of this one God, ſo I have alſo the image of the ſeverall perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in this capacitie as I am a Chriſtian, more then in my naturall faculties.</p>

                  <p> The attribute of the firſt perſon, the Father, is <hi>Power:</hi> and none but a Chriſtian hath power over thoſe great tyrants of the world, Sinne, Satan, Death, and Hell. For thus my power accrues and grows unto me: firſt, <hi>Poſſum judicare,</hi> I have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">1.

And <hi>Poſſum ſtare</hi> (which is another) I am able not onely to withſtand, but to ſtand out this battell of temptations to the end. And then, <hi>Poſſum capere;</hi> that which Chriſt propoſes for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his diſciples, <hi>He that is able to receive it,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 John 3. 9.</note> being born of God in Chriſt, I cannot ſinne. This that ſeems to have a name of impotence, <hi>Non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi>

                  <p>And then of the third alſo in this, that, his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute being goodneſſe, I, as a true Chriſtian, call nothing good, that conduceth not to the glorie of God in Chriſt Jeſus; nor any thing ill, that draws me not from him.

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> all things work together for my good, if I love God.

                     <hi>in bonum; Shew me a token of good:</hi> and God will ſhew me a preſent token of future good, an inward infallibilitie, that this very calamitie ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall and advantageous unto me: and ſo as in nature I have the image of God in my whole ſoul, and of all the three perſons in the three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties thereof; the underſtanding, the will, and the memorie: ſo in grace, in the Chriſtian Church, I have the ſame images of the power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the wiſdome of the Sonne, of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the holy Ghoſt, in my Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And all this we ſhall have in a better place then paradiſe (where we conſidered it in nature) and a better place then the Church, as it is mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant (where we conſidered it in grace) that is, in the kingdome of heaven (where we conſidered this image in glorie) which is our laſt word.</p>
                  <p>There we ſhall have this image of God in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: for if <hi>Origen</hi> could lodge ſuch a conceit, that in heaven at laſt all things ſhould ebbe back into God, as all things flowed from him at firſt; and ſo there ſhould be no other eſſence but God, all ſhould be God, even the devil himſelf: how much more may we conceive an unexpreſſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation (that is too farre off) an aſſimilation (that is not neare enough) an identification (the School would venture to ſay ſo) with God in that ſtate of glorie! Whereas the ſunne by ſhining upon the moon, makes the moon a planet, a ſtarre as well as it ſelf, which otherwiſe would be but the thickeſt and darkeſt part of that ſphere: ſo thoſe beams of glorie which ſhall iſſue from my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10526:41"/> God, and fall upon me, ſhall make me (otherwiſe a clod of earth, and worſe, a dark ſoul, a ſpirit of darkneſſe) an angel of light, a ſtarre of glorie, a ſomething that I cannot name now, not imagine now, nor to morrow, nor next yeare; but even in that particular, I ſhall be like God: that as he that asked a day to give a definition of God, the next day asked a week, and then a moneth, and then a yeare; ſo undeterminable would my imaginations be, if I ſhould go about to think now, what I ſhall be there: I ſhall be ſo like God, as that the devil himſelf ſhall not know me from God, ſo farre as to finde any more place to faſten a temptation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, then upon God; nor to conceive any more hope of my falling from that kingdome, then of Gods being driven out of it: for though I ſhall not be immortall as God, yet I ſhall be as immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall as God. And there is my image of God, of God conſidered all together, and in his unitie in the ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall have alſo then the image of all the three perſons of the Trinitie. <hi>Power</hi> is the Fathers; and a greater power then he exerciſes here, I ſhall have there: here he overcomes enemies, but yet here he hath enemies; there, there are none: here they cannot prevail; there they ſhall not be. So <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is the image of the Sonne; and there I ſhall have better wiſdome: the ſpirituall wiſdome it ſelf is here: for here our beſt wiſdome is, but to go towards our end; there it is to reſt in our end: here it is to ſeek to be glorified by God; there it is that God may be everlaſtingly glorified by me.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10526:42"/> The image of the holy Ghoſt is <hi>Goodneſſe.</hi> Here our goodneſſe is mixt with ſome ill; faith mixt with ſcruples, &amp; good works mixt with a love of praiſe, and hope of better mixt with fear of worſe: there I ſhall have ſincere goodneſſe, goodneſſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, intemerate and indeterminate goodneſſe; ſo good a place, as no ill accident ſhall annoy it; ſo good companie as no impertinent, no importune perſon ſhall diſorder it; ſo full a goodneſſe, as no evil of ſinne, no evil of puniſhment for former ſins can enter; ſo good a God, as ſhall no more keep us in fear of his anger, nor in need of his mercie; but ſhall fill us firſt, and eſtabliſh us in that fulneſſe in the ſame inſtant, and give us a ſatietie that we can wiſh no more, and an infallibilitie that we can loſe none of that, and both at once. Whereas the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſts</hi> expreſſe our neareneſſe to God in that ſtate, in that note, that the name of man and the name of God, ADAM and JEHOVAH, in their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall letters are equall: ſo I would have leave to expreſſe that inexpreſſible ſtate, ſo farre as to ſay, that if there can be other worlds imagined beſides this that is under our moon, and if there could be other Gods imagined of thoſe worlds, beſides this God to whoſe image we are made, in <hi>Nature,</hi> in <hi>Grace,</hi> in <hi>Glorie;</hi> I had rather be one of theſe Saints in this heaven, then one of thoſe Gods in thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worlds. I ſhall be like the angels in a glorified ſoul, and the angels ſhall not be like me in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bodie.</p>
                  <p>The holy nobleneſſe and religious ambition that I would imprint in you for attaining of this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10526:42"/> glorie, makes me diſmiſſe you with this note, for the fear of miſſing that glorie; that, as we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken juſt occaſion to magnifie the goodneſſe of God towards us, in that he ſpeaks plurally, <hi>Faciamus, Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> do this; &amp; ſo poures out the bleſſings of the whole Trinitie upon us, in this image of himſelf, in every perſon of the three, and in all theſe three wayes which we have conſidered: ſo when the anger of God is juſtly kindled againſt us, God collects himſelf, ſummons himſelf, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelf, muſters himſelf, and threatens plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally too: for of thoſe foure places in Scripture, in which onely (as we noted before) God ſpeaks of himſelf in a royall plurall, God ſpeaks in anger, and in a preparation to deſtruction, in one of thoſe foure entirely, as entirely he ſpeaks of mercie but in one of them, in this text; here he ſayes meerly out of mercie, <hi>Faciamus, Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, make man:</hi> and in the ſame pluralitie, the ſame univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, he ſayes after, <hi>Deſcendamus &amp; confundamus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, go down to them and confound them,</hi> as meerly out of indignation and anger, as here out of mercie. And in the other two places, where God ſpeaks plurally, he ſpeaks not meerly in mercie, nor meerly in juſtice in neither; but in both he mingles both: ſo that God carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo equally herein, as that no ſoul, no Church, no State may any more promiſe it ſelf patience in God if it provoke him, then ſuſpect anger in God if we conform our ſelves to him. For from them that ſet themſelves againſt him, God ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10526:43"/> his image in all the perſons and all the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes: the Father ſhall withdraw his power, and we ſhall be enfeebled in our forces; the Sonne his wiſdome, and we ſhall be enfatuated in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; the holy Ghoſt his goodneſſe, and we ſhall be corrupted in our manners, and corrupted in our religion, and be a prey to temporall and ſpirituall enemies, and change the image of God into the image of the beaſt. And as God loves nothing more then the image of himſelf in his Sonne, and then the image of his Sonne Chriſt Jeſus in us; ſo he hates nothing more then the image of Antichriſt in them in whom he had imprinted his Sonnes image; that is, declinations towards Antichriſt, or concurrences with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, in them who were born, and baptized, and catechized, &amp; bleſſed in the profeſſion of his truth.</p>
                  <p>That God, who hath hitherto delivered us from all cauſe or colour of jealouſies or ſuſpicions thereof in them whom he hath placed over us, ſo conform us to his image in a holy life, that ſinnes continued and multiplied by us againſt him, do not ſo provoke him againſt us, that thoſe two great helps, the aſſiduitie of preaching, and the perſonall and exemplarie pietie &amp; conſtancie in our Princes, be not by our ſinnes made unprofitable unto us: for that is the height of Gods malediction upon a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the aſſiduitie of preaching and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a religious Prince doth them no good, but aggravates their fault.</p>

                  <p>The firſt marriage that was made, God made; and he made it in Paradiſe: and of that marriage, I have had the like occaſion as this, to ſpeak before, in the preſence of many honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this companie. The laſt marriage which ſhall be made, God ſhall make too, and in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe too, in the kingdome of heaven: and at that marriage, I hope in him that ſhall make it, to meet, not ſome, but all this companie. The marriage in this text hath relation to both thoſe marriages.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10526:45"/> It is it ſelf the ſpirituall and myſticall marriage of Chriſt Jeſus to the Church, and to every mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageable ſoul in the Church: and it hath a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it looks back to the firſt marriage; for to that the firſt word carries us, becauſe from thence God takes his metaphor and compariſon, <hi>Sponſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, I will marrie:</hi> and then it hath a proſpect to the laſt marriage; for to that we are carried in the laſt word, <hi>In aeternum, I will marrie thee unto me for ever.</hi> Be pleaſed therefore to give me leave in this exerciſe, to ſhift the Scene thrice, and to preſent to your religious conſiderations three objects, three ſubjects: firſt, a ſecular mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in Paradiſe; ſecondly, a ſpirituall marriage, in the Church; and thirdly, an eternall marriage, in Heaven: And in each of theſe three, we ſhall preſent three circumſtances; firſt, the perſons, <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Tibi, I</hi> will marrie <hi>thee;</hi> and then the action, <hi>Sponſabo,</hi> I will <hi>marrie</hi> thee; and laſtly, the term, <hi>In aeternum,</hi> I will marrie thee to me <hi>for ever.</hi>

As the Apoſtles ſay, in the firſt generall Councel, <hi>We lay nothing upon you but things</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>neceſſarie;</hi> ſo we call nothing neceſſarie, but that which is commanded by God. If in heaven I may have the place of a man that hath performed the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10526:45"/> commandments of God, I will not change with him, that thinks he hath done more then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God enjoyned him. The rule of marriage for degrees and diſtance in bloud, is the law of God; but for conditions of men, there is no rule at all given. When God had made Adam and Eve in Paradiſe, though there were foure rivers in Paradiſe, God did not place Adam in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie on one ſide, and Eve in a Nunnerie on the other, and ſo a river between them. They that build walls and cloyſters to fruſtrate Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of marriage, advance the doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, in forbidding of marriage. The devil hath advantages enow againſt us, in bringing men and women together: it was a ſtrange and ſuperdevil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh invention, to give him a new advantage againſt us, by keeping men and women aſunder, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding marriage. Between the hereſie of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> that induced a communitie of women (any might take any) and the hereſie of the <hi>Tatians,</hi> that forbad all (none might take any) was a fair latitude. Between the opinion of the <hi>Manichaean</hi> hereticks, that thought women to be made by the devil; and the <hi>Colliridian</hi> hereticks, that ſacrificed to a woman, as to God, there is a fair diſtance. Between the denying of them ſouls, which <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> is charged to have done; and giving them ſuch ſouls, as that they may be prieſts, as the <hi>Peputian</hi> hereticks did, is a fair way for a moderate man to walk in. To make them gods, is ungodly; and to make them devils, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10526:46"/> to make them miſtreſſes, is unmanly; and to make them ſervants, is unnoble: to make them, as God made them, wives, is godly, and manly too. When in the Romane church they diſſolve mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in naturall kindred, in degrees where God forbids it not; when they diſſolve marriage upon ſpirituall kindred, becauſe my grandfather chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened that womans father; when they diſſolve marriage upon legall kindred, becauſe my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father adopted that womans father, they ſeparate thoſe whom God hath joyned ſo farre, as to give them leave to joyn in lawfull marriage. When men have made vows to abſtain from marriage, I would they would be content to trie a little longer then they do, whether they could keep that vow or no: And when men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated themſelves to the ſervice of God in his Church, I would they would be content to trie a little further then they do, whether they could abſtain or no: But to diſſolve marriages made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a vow, or after orders, is ſtill to ſeparate thoſe whom God hath not ſeparated. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are He and She, man and woman: they muſt be ſo much; he muſt be a man, ſhe muſt be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and they muſt be no more; not a brother and a ſiſter, not an uncle and a neece. <hi>Adduxit ad eum,</hi> was the caſe between Adam &amp; Eve; God brought them together: God will not bring me a precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted perſon; he will not have me defraud an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: God will not bring me a misbeleeving, a ſuperſtitious perſon; he will not have me drawn
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10526:46"/> from himſelf: But let them be perſons that God hath made, man and woman; and perſons that God hath brought together, that is, not put aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by any law of his; and all ſuch are perſons capable of this firſt, this ſecular marriage.</p>
                  <p>In which our ſecond conſideration is the action, <hi>Sponſabo;</hi> where the active is a kinde of paſſive: <hi>I will marrie thee,</hi> is, <hi>I will be married to thee;</hi> for we marrie not our ſelves. They are ſomewhat hard driven in the Romane church, when, making marriage a ſacrament, and being preſſed by us with this queſtion, If it be a ſacrament, who adminiſters it? who is the Prieſt? they are fain to anſwer, The Bridegroom and the Bride, he and ſhe are the Prieſt in that ſacrament. As marriage is a civil contract, it muſt be done ſo in publick, as that it may have the teſtimonie of men: as marriage is a religious contract, it muſt be ſo done, as that it may have the benediction of the Prieſt. In a marriage without teſtimonie of men, they cannot claim any benefit by the Law; in a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age without the benediction of the Prieſt, they cannot claim any benefit of the Church: for how matrimonially ſoever, ſuch perſons as have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves, may pretend to love and live together; yet all that love and all that life is but a regulated adulterie, it is not marriage.</p>
                  <p>Now this Inſtitution of marriage had 3 objects: Firſt, <hi>In uſtionem,</hi> it was given for a remedie againſt burning; and then, <hi>In prolem,</hi> for propagation, for children; and laſtly, <hi>In adjutorium,</hi> for mutuall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10526:47"/> help. As we conſider it the firſt way, <hi>In uſtionem,</hi> every heating is not a burning; every naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence does not require a marriage: nay, every flaming is not a burning; though a man continue under the flame of carnall temptation, as long as S. Paul did, yet it needs not come preſently to a <hi>Sponſabo, I will marry.</hi> God gave S. Paul other phyſick, <hi>Gratia mea ſufficit,</hi> grace to ſtand under that temptation: and S. Paul gave himſelf other phyſick, <hi>Contundo corpus,</hi> convenient diſciplines to tame his bodie. Theſe will keep a man from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri, eſt deſideriis vinci; deſideria pati, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtris eſt &amp; perfecti: To be overcome by our concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcencies, that is to burn; but to quench that fire by religious wayes, that is a noble, that is a perfect work.</hi> When God, at the firſt inſtitution of marriage, had this firſt uſe of marriage in his contemplation, that it ſhould be a remedie againſt burning, God gave man the remedie, before he had the diſeaſe: for marriage was inſtituted in the ſtate of innocencie, when there was no inordinateneſſe in the affections of man, and ſo no burning. But as God created Rheubarb in the world, whoſe qualitie is to purge choler, before there was any choler to purge: ſo God, according to his abundant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to do us good, created a remedie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſeaſe, which he foreſaw coming, was come upon us. Let him then, that takes his wife in this firſt and loweſt ſenſe, <hi>In medicinam,</hi> but <hi>as his phyſick,</hi> yet make her his cordiall phyſick, take her to his heart, and fill his heart with her; let her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10526:47"/> dwell there, and dwell there alone: and ſo they will be mutuall antidotes and preſervatives to one another, againſt all forrain temptations. And with this bleſſing bleſſe thou, O Lord, theſe whom thou haſt brought hither for this bleſſing: make all the dayes of their life, like this day unto them: and as thy mercies are new every morning, make them ſo to one another: and if they may not die together, ſuſtain thou the ſurviver of them in that ſad houre, with this comfort, that he that died for them both, will bring them together again in his everlaſtingneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond uſe of marriage was, <hi>In prolificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, For children:</hi> And therefore (as S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> puts the caſe) to contract before, that they will have no children, makes it no marriage, but an adultery. To deny themſelves to one another, is as much againſt marriage, as to give themſelves to another. To hinder that by phyſick, or any other practiſe; nay, to hinder that ſo farre, as by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate wiſh or prayer againſt children, conſiſts not well with this ſecond uſe of marriage. And yet in this ſecond uſe we do not ſo much conſider generation, as regeneration; not ſo much procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as education; nor propagation, as tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of children: for this world might be filled full enough of children, though there were no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but heaven could not be filled, nor the places of the fallen angels ſupplied, without that care of childrens religious education, which from parents in lawfull marriage they are likelieſt to receive.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10526:48"/> How infinite and how miſerable a circle of ſinne do we make, if, as we ſinned in our parents loyns before we were born, ſo we ſinne in our childrens actions when we are dead, by having given them either example or libertie of ſinning! We have a fearfull commination from God, upon a good man, upon <hi>Eli,</hi> for his not reſtraining the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his ſonnes: <hi>I will do a thing in Iſrael,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 11</note> ſayes God there, <hi>at which both the eares of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle:</hi> and it was executed; <hi>Eli</hi> fell down, and broke his neck. We have alſo <note place="margin">1. Sam. 4. 18</note> a promiſe of conſolation to women, for children: <hi>She ſhall be ſaved in childe-bearing,</hi> ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 15</note> but, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and others of the ancients obſerve and interpret that place (which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ariſes out of the very letter) it is, <hi>Si perman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerint;</hi> not, <hi>If ſhe,</hi> but, <hi>If they,</hi> if the children <hi>continue in faith, and charitie, and holineſſe, with ſobrietie.</hi> The ſalvation of the parents hath ſo much relation to the childrens goodneſſe, as that, if they be ill by the parents example or indulgence, the parents are as guiltie as the children. Art thou afraid thy childe ſhould be ſtung with a ſnake, and wilt thou let him play with the old ſerpent, in opening himſelf to all temptations? Art thou afraid to let him walk in an ill aire, and art thou content to let him ſtand in that peſtilent aire, that is made of nothing but oathes and execrations of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mouthes round about him? It is S. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes</hi> complaint, <hi>Perditionem magno pretio emunt, ſalutem nec dono accipere volunt:</hi> we pay deere for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10526:48"/> our childrens damnation, by paying at firſt for all their childiſh vanities, and then for their ſinfull inſolencies at any rate; and we might have them ſaved, and our ſelves to the bargain (which were a frugall way, and a debt well hedged in) for much leſſe then ours and their damnation ſtands us in. If you have a deſire, ſayes that bleſſed Father, to leave them certainly rich, <hi>Deum iis relinque debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem; Do ſome ſuch thing for Gods ſervice, as you may leave God in their debt.</hi> He cannot break; his eſtate is inexhauſtible: He will not break promiſe, nor break day; <hi>He will ſhew mercie unto thouſands, in them that love him, and keep his commandments.</hi> And here alſo may another ſhower of his benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions fall upon them, whom he hath prepared and preſented here; Let the <hi>wife</hi> be as <hi>a fruitfull</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſ. 128. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>vine,</hi> and their <hi>children</hi> like <hi>olive-plants.</hi> To thy glorie, let the parents expreſſe the love of parents, and the children, to thy glorie, the obedience of children, till they both loſe that ſecular name of parents and children, and meet all alike, in one new name, all ſaints in thy kingdome, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants there.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt uſe in this inſtitution of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular marriage, was, <hi>In adjutorium, For mutuall help.</hi> There is no ſtate, no man in any ſtate, that needs not the help of others. Subjects need Kings; and if Kings do not need their ſubjects, they need alliances abroad, and they need counſel at home. Even in paradiſe, where the earth produced all things for life, without labour, and the beaſts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10526:49"/> ſubmitted themſelves to man, ſo that he had no outward enemie; and in the ſtate of innocencie in paradiſe, where, in man, all the affections ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to reaſon, ſo that he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemie; yet God, in this abundant paradiſe, and in this ſecure innocencie of paradiſe, even in the ſurvey of his own works, ſaw, that though all that he had made, was good, yet he had not made all good; he found thus much defect in his own work, that man lacked an helper. Every bodie needs the help of others; and every good bodie does give ſome kinde of help to others. Even into the ark it ſelf, where God bleſſed them all with a powerfull and an immediate protection, God admitted onely ſuch, as were fitted to help one another, couples. In the ark, which was the type of our beſt condition in this life, there was not a ſingle perſon. Chriſt ſaved once one thief at the laſt gaſp, to ſhow that there may be late repentances: but in the ark he ſaved none but married perſons, to ſhow, that he eaſes himſelf in making them helpers to one another. And therefore when we come to the <hi>Poſui Deum adjuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium meum,</hi> to relie upon God primarily for our helper; God comes to the <hi>Faciam tibi adjutorium, I will make thee a help like thy ſelf:</hi> not alwayes like in complexion, nor like in yeares, nor like in fortune, nor like in birth; but like in minde, like in diſpoſition, like in the love of God and of one another, or elſe there is no helper. It was no kinde of help, that <hi>Davids</hi> wife gave him, when ſhe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10526:49"/> ſpoke by way of counſel, but in truth in ſcorn and deriſion, to draw him from a religious act, as the dancing before the ark at that time was. It is no help, for any reſpect, to ſlacken the husband in his religion. It was but a poore help that <hi>Nabals</hi> wife was fain to give him, by telling <hi>David,</hi> Alas, my husband is but a fool, like his name; and what will you look for at a fools hand? It is the worſt help of all, to raiſe a husband by dejecting her ſelf; to help her husband forward in this world, by forfeiting ſinfully and diſhonourably her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the next. The husband is the helper in the nature of a foundation, to ſuſtain and uphold all; the wife in the nature of the roof, to cover imperfections and weakneſſes: the husband in the nature of the head, from whence all the ſinews flow; the wife in the nature of the hands, into which thoſe ſinews flow, and enable them to do their offices: the husband helps as legs to her; ſhe moves by his motion: the wife helps as a ſtaffe to him; he moves the better by her aſſiſtance. And let this mutuall help be a part of our preſent benediction too: In all the wayes of fortune, let his induſtrie help her; and in all the croſſes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, let her patience help him; and in all emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſions and dangers, ſpirituall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>O God, make ſpeed to ſave them; O Lord, make haſte to help them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſpoken of the perſons, Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Him and Her; and of the action, firſt, as it is phyſick, but cordiall phyſick; and then for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10526:50"/> but children to be made the children of God; and laſtly for help, but true help, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall help: there remains yet in this ſecular marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the term how long, for ever; <hi>I will marrie thee for ever.</hi> Now though there be properly no eternitie in this ſecular marriage, nor in any thing in this world, (for eternitie is onely that which never had beginning, nor ever ſhall have end) yet we may conſider a kinde of eternitie, a kinde of circle, without beginning, without end, even in this ſecular marriage: for firſt, marriage ſhould have no beginning before marriage; no half marriages, no lending away of the minde in conditionall precontracts before, no lending away of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in unchaſte wantonneſſe before. The bodie is the temple of the holy Ghoſt; and when two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by marriage are to be made one temple, the wife is not as the chancell, reſerved and ſhut up, and the man as the walks below, indifferent and at libertie for every paſſenger. God in his temple looks for firſt-fruits from both; that ſo, on both ſides, marriage ſhould have ſuch a degree of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as to have had no beginning of marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage. It ſhould have this degree of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie too, this qualitie of a circle, to have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, no breaking in the way, by unjuſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions and jealouſies. Where there is <hi>ſpiritus immunditiei,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>A ſpirit of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> there will neceſſarily be <hi>ſpiritus zelotypiae,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> calls it, <hi>A ſpirit of jealouſie.</hi> But to raiſe the devil in the power of the devil, to call up one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10526:50"/> ſpirit by another ſpirit, by the ſpirit of jealouſie and ſuſpicion, to induce the ſpirit of uncleanneſſe where it was not, if a man conjure up a devil ſo, God knows who ſhall conjure it down again. As jealouſie is a care, and not a ſuſpicion, God is not aſhamed to proteſt of himſelf, that he is <hi>a jealous God.</hi> God commands that no idolatrie be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bowe down to a graven image;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 5</note> and before he accuſes any man to have bowed down to a graven image, before any idolatrie was committed, he tells them that he is a jealous God; God is jealous before there be any harm done. And God preſents it as a curſe, when he ſayes, <hi>My jealouſie ſhall depart from thee, and I will be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eze. 16. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>quiet, and no more angrie;</hi> that is, I will leave thee to thy ſelf, and take no more care of thee. Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie that implies care, and honour, and counſel, and tenderneſſe, is rooted in God; for God is a jealous God, and his ſervants are jealous ſervants, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſes of himſelf, <hi>I am jealous over</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 2</note> 
                     <hi>you with a godly jealouſie.</hi> But jealouſie that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies diffidence, and ſuſpicion, and accuſation, is rooted in the devil; for he is <hi>The accuſer of the brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then this ſecular marriage ſhould be <hi>In aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> eternall, for ever, as to have no beginning before, and ſo too, as to have no jealous interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by the way; for it is ſo eternall, as that it can have no end in this life. Thoſe whom God hath joyned, no man, no devil can ſeparate ſo, as that it ſhall not remain a marriage ſo farre, as that,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10526:51"/> if thoſe ſeparated perſons will live together again, yet they ſhall not be new married; ſo farre, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the band of marriage continues ſtill. The devil makes no marriages: he may have a hand in drawing conveyances; in the temporall conditions there may be practiſe; but the marriage is made by God in heaven. The devil can break no marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages neither, though he can by ſinne break off all the good uſes, and take away all the comforts of marriage. I pronounce not now, whether adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diſſolve marriage or no: It is S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> wiſdome to ſay, <hi>When the Scripture is ſilent, let me be ſilent too:</hi> and I may go lower then he, and ſay, <hi>Where the Church is ſilent, let me be ſilent too;</hi> and our Church is ſo farre ſilent in this, as that it hath not ſaid, that adulterie diſſolves marriage. Perchance then it is not the death of marriage; but ſurely it is a deadly wound. We have authours in the <hi>Romane</hi> church, that think <hi>Fornicationem non vagam,</hi> that ſuch an incontinent life, as is limited to one certain perſon, is no deadly ſinne: but there are none, even amongſt them, that dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the crime of adulterie. <hi>Habere quaſi non habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> is Chriſts counſel; to have a wife, as though thou hadſt none, that is, for continencie and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and forbearance, and abſtinence upon ſome occaſions. But, <hi>Non habere quaſi haberes,</hi> is not ſo: not to have a wife, and yet have her; to have her that is anothers, this is the devils counſel. Of that ſalutation of the Angel to the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, <hi>Bleſſed art thou amongſt women,</hi> we may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10526:51"/> make ever this interpretation, not onely that ſhe was bleſſed <hi>amongst</hi> women, that is, <hi>above</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but that ſhe was <hi>Benedicta, Bleſſed</hi> amongſt women, that all women bleſt her, that no woman had occaſion to curſe her. And this is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of this ſecular marriage, as farre as this world admits any eternitie, that it ſhould have no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before, no interruption of jealouſie in the way, no ſuch approach towards diſſolution, as that incontinencie, in all opinions, and in all Churches, is agreed to be. And here alſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple of fear, or of ſuſpicion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, there is place for this benediction upon this couple: Build, O Lord, upon thine own foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, in theſe two, and eſtabliſh thy former graces with future; that no perſon ever complain of either of them, nor either of them of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and ſo he and ſhe are married <hi>in aeternum, for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are come now, in our order propoſed at <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>II</label> firſt, to our ſecond part; for all is ſaid that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of the ſecular marriage. And of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the ſpirituall marriage, much needs not to be ſaid: there is another prieſt that contracts that, another preacher that celebrates that, the Spirit of God, to our ſpirit. And for the third marriage, the eternall marriage, it is a boldneſſe to offer to ſay any thing of a thing ſo inexpreſſible as the joyes of heaven; it is a diminution of them, to go about to heighten them; it is a ſhadowing of them, to go about to lay any colours or lights up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10526:52"/> them. But yet your patience may perchance laſt to a word of each of theſe three circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the perſons, the action, the term, both in this ſpirituall and in the eternall marriage.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, as in the former part, the ſecular mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for the perſons there, we conſidered firſt Adam and Eve; and after, every man and woman, and this couple in particular: ſo in this ſpirituall marriage, we conſider firſt Chriſt and his Church, for the perſons; but more particularly, Chriſt and my ſoul. And can theſe perſons meet? In ſuch a diſtance, and in ſuch a diſparagement, can perſons meet? The Sonne of God, and the ſonne of man? When I conſider Chriſt to be <hi>Germen Jehovae,</hi> the bud and bloſſome, the fruit &amp; off-ſpring of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, Jehovah himſelf; and my ſelf, before he took me in hand, to be, not a potters veſſel of earth, but that earth of which the potter might make a veſſel if he would, and break it if he would, when he had made it: when I conſider Chriſt to have been from before all beginnings, and to be ſtill the image of the Father, the ſame ſtamp upon the ſame metall; and my ſelf a piece of ruſty copper, in which thoſe lines of the image of God, which were imprinted in me, in my creation, are defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and worn, and waſhed, and burnt, and ground away by my many, and many, and many ſinnes: when I conſider Chriſt in his circle, in glorie with his Father, before he came into this world, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a glorious Church when he was in this world, and glorifying that Church, with that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10526:52"/> which himſelf had before, when he went out of this world; and then conſider my ſelf in my circle, I came into this world waſhed in mine own tears, and either out of compunction for my ſelf, or compaſſion for others, I paſſe through this world, as through a valley of tears, where tears ſettle and ſwell; and when I paſſe out of this world, I have their eyes, whoſe hands cloſe mine, full of tears too: Can theſe perſons, this image of God, this God himſelf, this glorious God, and this veſſel of earth, this earth it ſelf, this inglorious worm of the earth, meet without diſparagement?</p>
                  <p>They do meet, and make a marriage: becauſe I am not a bodie onely, but a bodie and ſoul; there is a marriage, and Chriſt marries me. As by the Law a man might marrie a captive woman in the <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 12</note> warres, if he ſhaved her head, and pared her nails, and changed her clothes: ſo my Saviour having fought for my ſoul, fought to bloud, to death, to the death of the croſſe for her; having ſtudied my ſoul ſo much, as to write all thoſe epiſtles, which are in the New Teſtament, to my ſoul; having preſented my ſoul with his own picture, that I can ſee his face in all his temporall bleſſings; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhaved her head, in abating her pride; and pared her nails, in contracting her greedie deſires; and changed her clothes, not to faſhion her ſelf after this world; my ſoul being thus fitted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Chriſt Jeſus hath married my ſoul; married her to all the three intendments mentioned in the ſecular marriage: Firſt, <hi>In uſtionem, Againſt</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:10526:53"/> 
                     <hi>burning;</hi> that, whether I burn my ſelf in the fire of temptation, by expoſing my ſelf to occaſions of temptation; or be reſerved to be burnt by others in the fires of perſecution and martyrdome; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fires of ambition, or envie, or luſt, or the everlaſting fires of hell offer at me, in an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the judgements of God; yet, as the Spirit of God ſhall wipe all teares from mine eyes, ſo the teares of Chriſt Jeſus ſhall extinguiſh all fires in my heart: and ſo it is a marriage, <hi>In uſtionem,</hi> a remedie againſt burning. It is ſo too, <hi>In prolifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem, For children.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Vae ſoli,</hi> Wo unto that ſingle ſoul that is not married to Chriſt, that is not come into the way of having iſſue by him, that is not incorporated in the Chriſtian Church, and in the true Church; but is yet either in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of idolatrie amongſt the Gentiles, or in the labyrinth of ſuperſtition amongſt the Papiſts. <hi>Vae ſoli,</hi> Wo unto that ſingle man, that is not married to Chriſt in the ſacraments of the Church; and, <hi>Vae ſterili,</hi> Wo unto them that are barren after this ſpirituall marriage: for that is a great curſe in the Prophet <hi>Jeremie, Scribe virum iſtum ſterilem,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Matt. 21. 19</note> 
                     <hi>henceforward for ever,</hi> preſently the whole tree withered: if no fruit, no leaves neither, nor bodie left. To be incorporated in the bodie of Chriſt Jeſus, and bring forth no fruits worthy of that profeſſion, is a wofull ſtate too. <hi>Vae ſoli:</hi> Firſt, Wo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10526:53"/> unto the Gentiles not married to Chriſt: and, <hi>Vae ſterili,</hi> Wo unto inconſiderate Chriſtians, that think not upon their calling, that conceive not by Chriſt: but there is a <hi>Vae pregnanti</hi> too, Wo unto <note place="margin">Matt. 24. 19</note> them that are with childe, and are never deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that have ſometimes good conceptions, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſitions, holy deſires to the advancement of Gods truth; but, for ſome collaterall reſpects, dare not utter them, nor bring them to their birth, to any effect. The purpoſe of his marriage to us, is, to have children by us: and this is his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and his preſent fecunditie, that working now by me in you, in one inſtant he hath children in me, and grand-children by me. He hath married me <hi>In uſtionem,</hi> and <hi>In prolem; Againſt burning,</hi> and <hi>for children:</hi> but can he have any uſe of me, <hi>In adjutorium, For a helper?</hi> Surely, if I be able to feed him, and clothe him, and harbour him (and Chriſt would not condemne men at the laſt day for not doing theſe, if man could not do them) I am able to help him too. Great perſons can help him over ſea, convey the name of Chriſt, where it hath not been preached yet: and they can help him home again, reſtore his name and his truth, where ſuperſtition with violence hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeized him: and they can help him at home, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his truth there, againſt all machinations to diſplant and diſpoſſeſſe him. Great men can help him thus: and every man can help him to a better place in his own heart, and his own actions, then he hath had there; and to be ſo helped in me, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10526:54"/> helped by me, to have his glorie thereby advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Chriſt hath married my ſoul. And he hath married it <hi>In aeternum, For ever;</hi> which is the third and laſt circumſtance in this ſpirituall, as it was in the ſecular marriage. And here the <hi>Aeternum</hi> is enlarged. In the ſecular marriage it was an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie conſidered onely in this life; but this eternitie is not begun in this world, but from all eternitie, in the book of life, in Gods eternall decree for my election; there Chriſt was married to my ſoul. Chriſt was never in minoritie, never under yeares; there was never any time, when he was not as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the Ancient of dayes, as old as his Father. But when my ſoul was in a ſtrange minoritie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite millions of millions of generations before my ſoul was a ſoul, did Chriſt marrie my ſoul in his eternall decree: ſo it was eternall, it had no beginning. Neither doth he interrupt this, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me any occaſion of jealouſie by the way, but loves my ſoul as though there were no other ſoul, and would have done and ſuffered all that he did for me alone, if there had been no name but mine in the book of life. And as he hath married me to him <hi>In aeternum, For ever,</hi> before all beginning; and <hi>In aeternum, For ever,</hi> without any interruptions: ſo I know, that whom he loves, he loves to the end; and that he hath given me, not a <hi>preſumptuous impoſsibilitie,</hi> but a <hi>modeſt infallibilitie,</hi> that no ſinne of mine ſhall divorce or ſeparate me from him: for that which ends the ſecular marriage, doth not end the ſpirituall; not death: for my death
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10526:54"/> doth not take me from that husband; but that huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being by his Father preferred to higher titles and greater glorie in another ſtate, I do but go by death, where he is become a King, to have my part in that glorie, &amp; in thoſe additions, which he hath received there. And this hath led us to our third and laſt marriage, our eternall marriage, in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Church.</p>
                  <p>And in this third marriage, the perſons are the <label type="milestone">

                  <p>This is not a clandeſtine marriage, not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſeal of Chriſt in the obſignation of his Spirit; and yet ſuch a clandeſtine marriage is a good mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: nor is it ſuch a pariſh-marriage, as when Chriſt married me to himſelf at my baptiſme, in a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10526:55"/> Church here; and yet that marriage of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſoul to Chriſt in that ſacrament, is a bleſſed marriage: But this is a marriage in that great and glorious congregation, where all my ſinnes ſhall be laid open to the eyes of all the world; where all the bleſſed Virgins ſhall ſee all my uncleanneſſes, and all the Martyrs ſee all my tergiverſations, and all the Confeſſours ſee all my double dealings in Gods cauſe; where <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall ſee my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe in Gods promiſes, and <hi>Job</hi> my impatience in Gods corrections, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> my hardneſſe of heart in diſtributing Gods bleſſings to the poore: and thoſe Virgins, and Martyrs, and Confeſſours, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and all that congregation, ſhall look upon the Lambe, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and upon one another, as though they would all forbid thoſe banes, and ſay to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, Will this Lambe have any thing to do with this ſoul? And yet there and then this Lambe ſhall marrie me, and marrie me <hi>In aeternum, For ever;</hi> which is our laſt circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>It is not well done to call it a circumſtance; for the eternitie is a great part of the eſſence of that marriage. Conſider then how poore and needie a thing all the riches of this world, how flat and taſtleſſe a thing all the pleaſures of this world, how pallid, and faint, and dilute a thing all the honours of this world are, when the very treaſure, and joy, and glorie of heaven it ſelf were unperfect, if it were not eternall: and my marriage ſhall be ſo, <hi>In aeternum, For ever.</hi> The Angels

                  <p>Firſt, in the Metaphor that Chriſt is called a ſtone, the firmneſſe is expreſſed: forasmuch as he loved his own which were in the world, <hi>In finem dilexit eos,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John, He loved them to the end,</hi>

God gives not his people health, and then leaves them to a boldneſſe in ſurfeting; nor beautie, and then leaves them to a confidence, and opening themſelves to all ſollicitations; nor valour, and then leaves them to a ſpirituous quarrelſomneſſe: God makes no patterns of his works, nor models of his houſes; he makes whole pieces, and perfect houſes: he puts his children into good wayes, and he directs and protects them in thoſe wayes; for this is the conſtancie and perſeverance of the love of Chriſt Jeſus to us, as he is called in this Text <hi>a ſtone.</hi>

                     <hi>which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now when S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayes (as he doth in the 2 and 3 places) that this place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is one of thoſe places, of which <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, <hi>Quaedam difficilia, There are ſome things in S.

And therefore to place ſalvation or damnation in ſuch an abſolute decree of God, as ſhould have no relation to the fall of man, and reparation in a Redeemer, this is to remove this ſtone out of the foundation; for a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10526:61"/> Chriſtian may well be content to begin at Chriſt: if any man therefore have laid any other foundation to his poſſeſſion of great places, alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in great families, ſtrong practiſe in courts, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations upon dependants, acclamations of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; if he have laid any other foundation, for pleaſure and contentment, care of health and complexion, delight in diſcourſe, cheerfulneſſe in diſportings, interchange of ſecrets, and ſuch other ſmall wares of court and cities as theſe are: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath laid ſuch foundations as theſe, muſt needs do as that Generall did when he beſieged a town, who compounded to take it to mercie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a condition, that in ſigne of ſubjection they ſhould ſuffer him to take one row of ſtones from their walls; whereupon he took away the loweſt row, the foundation, and ſo ruined and demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole walls of the citie: ſo muſt he that hath theſe foundations, that is, theſe habits, diveſt the habit, root out the loweſt ſtone, the generall and radicall inclination of theſe diſorders: for he ſhall never be able to watch and reſiſt every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular temptation, if he truſt onely to his morall conſtancie; no, nor if he place Chriſt for the roof, to cover his ſinnes, when he hath done them: his mercie works, by way of pardon after, not by way of an <hi>Obſtante,</hi> and priviledge, to do a ſinne before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; but beforehand he muſt be in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in our eye, when we undertake any particular action; in the beginning, for there he is to be in the firſt place, <hi>Lapis fundamentalis.</hi> And then after we

                  <p>Conſider firſt what divers things he unites in his own perſon, that he ſhould be the ſonne of a woman, and yet no ſonne of man; that the ſonne of a woman ſhould be the Sonne of God; that mans nature and innocencie ſhould meet together; a man that ſhould not ſinne; that Gods nature and mortalitie ſhould meet together, be God that muſt die: briefly, that he ſhould do and ſuffer many things, impoſſible as man, impoſſible as God; thus he was a corner-ſtone, that brought together natures naturally incompatible: Thus he was <hi>Lapis angularis, a corner-ſtone,</hi> in his perſon.</p>
                  <p>Conſider him in his offices, as a Redéemer, as a Mediatour, and ſo he hath united God to man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious men to jealous God; yea, ſuch a corner ſtone, as hath builded heaven and earth, Jeruſalem and Babel together; thus in his perſon, and thus in his offices.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:10526:62"/>
                  <p> Conſider him in his power, and he is ſuch a corner-ſtone as he is the God of grace, and love, and union, and concord; ſuch a corner-ſtone as is able to reconcile and unite (as he did in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams houſe) a wife and a concubine in one bed, a covetous father and a waſtfull ſonne in one fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, a ſevere magiſtrate and a licentious people in one citie, an abſolute Prince and a jealous people in one kingdome, law and conſcience in one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſcripture and tradition in one Church. If we will but conſider Chriſt Jeſus the life and ſoul of all our accounts, and all our purpoſes; if we would mingle that ſweetneſſe and ſuppleneſſe, which he loves, and which he is, in all our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; if in all our controverſies (book-contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and ſword-controverſies) we would fit them to him, and ſee how neare they would meet in him, that is, how neare we could come to be friends, and yet both ſides good Chriſtians: then we placed this ſtone in the ſecond right place: who as he is a corner-ſtone, reconciling God and man, in his own perſon; and God and man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling mankinde in his office: ſo he deſires to be a corner-ſtone in reconciling man and man, and ſetting peace amongſt our ſelves, not for worldly ends, but for this reſpect; that we might all meet in him to love one another, not becauſe we made a ſtronger partie by that love, not becauſe we made a ſweeter converſation by that love; but becauſe we meet cloſer in the boſome of Chriſt Jeſus, where we muſt all at laſt either reſt all together,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10526:62"/> or elſe be all together eternally thrown out, or be eternally ſeparated and divorced one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Having then received Chriſt as a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtone, we beleeve aright; and for the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, we interpret charitably the opinions and accounts of other men: the next is, that he is <hi>Lapis Jacob,</hi> a ſtone of reſt and ſecuritie to our ſouls. When Jacob was in his journey, he took a ſtone, and that ſtone was his pillow; when that he ſlept all night, and reſted upon the ſtone, he ſaw the ladder that reached from heaven to earth: it is much to have this egreſſe and regreſſe to God, to have a ſenſe of being gone from him, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and means of returning to him. When we do fall into particular ſinnes, it is well if we can take hold of the firſt ſtep of this ladder, with that hand of <hi>David, Domine reſpice in teſtamentum,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord conſider the covenant:</hi> if we can remember God of his covenant to his people and to their ſeed, it is well. That is more, if we can clamber a ſtep higher on this ladder, to a <hi>Domine labia mea aperi,</hi> if we can come to open our lips in a true confeſſion of our wretched condition, and of thoſe ſinnes by which we have forfeited our intereſt in that covenant; it is more, and more then that too, if we can come to that, <hi>Inebriabo me lacrymis,</hi> if we overflow and make our ſelves drunk with teares, in a true ſenſe and ſorrow for thoſe ſinnes; ſtill it is more then all theſe, if we can expoſtulate with God in an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque quò Domine?</hi> How long Lord ſhall I take counſel within my ſelf, having wearineſſe in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10526:63"/> my heart? Theſe ſteps, theſe gradations to God do well. Warre is a degree of peace, as it is the way to prayer; and this colluctation and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, brings a man to peace with him: But then is a man upon the ſtone of <hi>David,</hi> when in a fairer, and even, and conſtant religious courſe of life, he enters into ſheets every night, as though his executours had cloſed him, as though his neighbours next day were to ſhrowd and winde him in thoſe ſheets, and lies down every night, not as though his man was to call him up the next day morning to hunt, or to the next dayes ſport buſineſſe, but as though the Angels were to call him to the reſurrection. And this is our third be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, as Chriſt is a ſtone, we have ſecuritie and peace of conſcience in him. The next is, that he is <hi>Lapis David,</hi> the ſtone with which he ſlew <hi>Goliah,</hi> and with which we may overcome all our enemies. <hi>Sicut baculus crucis, ità lapis Chriſti habet typum,</hi> ſayes <hi>Auguſtine; Davids</hi> ſling was a type of the croſſe, and the ſtone was a type of Chriſt. We will chooſe to inſiſt upon ſpirituall enemies, ſinnes. And this is the ſtone that enables the weakeſt man to overthrow the ſtrongeſt ſinne, if he proced as <hi>David</hi> did. <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Goliah, Thou comeſt to me with a ſword, with a ſpear, and with a ſhield; but I come unto thee in the name of the God of hoſts, of Iſrael,</hi> whom thou haſt railed upon. If thou watch the approach of any ſinne, any giant ſinne that tranſports thee moſt, if thou apprehend it to rail againſt the Lord of hoſts, in that there is a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10526:63"/> loud and active blaſphemie againſt God in every ſinne; if it deſire to come with a ſword, or a ſpear, perſwaſions of advancement if thou do it, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of diſhonour if thou do it not; if it come with a ſhield, with promiſes to cover and palliate it if thou do it: if then this David, thy attempted ſoul, can put his hand into his bag, as <hi>David</hi> did, (for, <hi>Quid cor hominis niſi ſacculus Dei?</hi> mans heart is that bag in which God layes up all good dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) if he can take into his conſideration his Chriſt Jeſus, and ſling out his works, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, his merits; this Goliah, this giant ſinne will fall to the ground. And then as it is ſaid of <hi>David</hi> there, that he ſlew him when he had no ſword in his hand; and yet in the next verſe, that he took his ſword and ſlew him with that: ſo even by the conſideration of that which my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath done for me, I ſhall give this ſinne the firſt deaths wound, and then I ſhall kill him with his own ſword; his own abomination, his own foulneſſe ſhall make me deteſt him: if I dare but look him in the face, if I dare call him, I come in the name of the Lord, if I conſider him, I ſhall triumph over him: <hi>Et dabit certandi victoriam, qui dedit certandi audaciam;</hi> That God who gave me courage to fight, will give me courage to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                  <p>The laſt benefit, which we conſider in Chriſt as he is a ſtone, is, that he is <hi>Petra, A rock:</hi> the rock gave water to the Iſraelites, and he gave them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">Num. 20. 11.</note> out of the ſtone, and oyl out of the rock. Now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10526:64"/> when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that our fathers drank of the ſame rock, as we heard, that rock was Chriſt, ſo <note place="margin">1.

And therefore <hi>Laudate Dominum habitationes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 11.</note> ſayes the Prophet, <hi>You that are inhabitants of this rock,</hi> you that dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in you, you that dwell in earth, in this rock, praiſe ye the Lord, bleſſe him, and magnifie him for ever. If the ſonne ſhall ask bread of the father, will he give him a ſtone, as is Chriſts queſtion? Yes, O bleſſed Father, we ask no other: anſwer to our petition; no better ſatisfaction to our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, when we ſay, <hi>Da nobis hodie panem, Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> then that thou give us this ſtone, this rock, thy ſelf in the Church for our direction, thy ſelf in thy ſacraments for our refection; what hardneſſe ſoever we finde there, what corrections ſoever we receive there, all ſhall be of eaſie digeſtion and good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us: thy holy Spirit of patience ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand theſe ſtones to be made bread, and we ſhall finde more juice, more marrow in theſe ſtones, in theſe afflictions, then worldly men ſhall do in the ſoftneſſe of their oyl, in the ſweetneſſe of their honie, in the cheerfulneſſe of their wine: for as Chriſt is our foundation, we beleeve in him; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10526:64"/> our corner ſtone, we are at peace with all the world in him: as he is <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſtone, giving us peace in our ſelves; and <hi>Davids</hi> ſtone, giving us victorie over all our enemies: ſo he is a rock of ſtone; no affliction, no tribulation ſhall ſhake us. And ſo we have paſſed through all the benefits propoſed to be conſidered in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>It is ſome degree of thankfulneſſe to ſtand long <note place="margin">II Part.</note> in the contemplation of the benefits which we have received, and therefore we have inſiſted thus long upon this firſt part: But it is a degree of ſpirituall wiſdome too, to make haſte to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of our dangers, and therefore we come now to them: we will fall upon this ſtone and be broken; this ſtone may fall upon us and grinde us to powder. And in the firſt of theſe, we may conſider, <hi>Quid frangi, Quid cadere;</hi> What that falling upon this ſtone is, and what it is to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon it; and then the latitude of this, <hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10526:65"/> to ſtumble at: for if a man walk in a gallerie, where windows and ſtatues and tables are all of marble, yet if he walk in the dark, or blinde-fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or careleſly, he may break his face as danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt that rich ſtone, as if it were but brick: ſo though a man walk in the true Church of God, in that Jeruſalem, which is deſcribed in the Revelation, whoſe foundation, and gates, and walls are all precious ſtone; yet if a man bring misbelief, all his religion is but a part of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and order: if a man be ſcandalized at that humilitie, that patience, that povertie, that lowlineſſe of ſpirit, which the Chriſtian religion inclines us unto; if he will ſay, <hi>Si rex Iſrael,</hi> If Chriſt will be King, let him come down from the croſſe, and then we will beleeve in him; let him deliver his Church from all croſſes, firſt of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then of perſecution, and then we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him to be King: if he will ſay, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare,</hi> We will admit Chriſt, but we will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to reigne over us, to be King; if he will be content with a Conſulſhip, with a Colleagueſhip, that he and the world may joyn in government, that we may give the week to the world, and the ſabbath unto him, and the night to our licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; that of the day we may give the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon to him, and the afternoon to our pleaſures; if this will ſerve Chriſt, we can be content to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him: but <hi>Nolumus regnare,</hi> We will not admit of his abſolute power, that whether we eat or drink, or whatſoever we do, we muſt be troubled to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10526:65"/> think on him, and reſpect his glorie in every thing; if he will ſay, <hi>Praecepit Angelis,</hi> God hath given charge to his Angels, and therefore we need not look to our own wayes; he hath locked us up ſafe, and lodged us ſafely under an eternall election, and therefore we are ſure of ſalvation: if he will walk thus blindely, violently, wilfully, negligently in the true Church, though he walk amongſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires, and pearls, and chryſolites which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned there, that is, in the outward common and fellowſhip of Gods ſaints; yet he may bruiſe, and break, and batter himſelf aſmuch againſt theſe, as againſt the ſtone gods of the Heathen, or the ſtone idols of the Papiſts: for firſt, the place of this falling upon this ſtone is the true Church: <hi>Qui jacet in terra,</hi> He that is alreadie upon the ground, can fall no lower, till he fall to hell; but he whom God hath brought into his Church, if he come to a confident ſecuritie that he is gone farre enough in theſe outward acts of religion, he falls, though he be upon this ſtone. This is the place of the true Church; the falling it ſelf (as farre as will fall into one time of conſideration now) is a falling into ſome particular ſinne, but not of ſuch as quenches our faith; we fall ſo as we may riſe again: S. <hi>Jerome</hi> expreſſeth it ſo, <hi>Qui cadit, &amp; tamen cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> He that falls and yet beleeves, <hi>revocatur per poenitentiam ad ſalutem,</hi> that man is reſerved by Gods purpoſe to come by repentance to ſalvation: for this man that falls here, falls not ſo deſperately, as that he feels nothing between him and hell,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10526:66"/> nothing to ſtop at, nothing to check him by the way: <hi>Cadit ſuper,</hi> he falls upon ſomething, he falls not upon flowers, to wallow and tumble in his ſinne; nor upon feathers, to reſt and ſleep in his ſinne; nor into a cooling river, to diſport and refreſh and ſtrengthen himſelf in his ſinne: but he falls upon a ſtone where he may receive a bruiſe and pain upon his fall, a remorſe of that ſinne that he is fallen into. And in this fall our infirmities appeare three wayes: the firſt is, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingere in lapidem;</hi> for though he be upon the right ſtone, in the true religion, and have life enough, yet <hi>Impingimus meridie,</hi> (as the Prophet ſayes) <hi>Even</hi>

                     <hi>at noon we ſtumble:</hi> we have much more light by Chriſt being come, then the Jews had, but are ſorie we have it: when Chriſt ſaid to us, for the better underſtanding of the Law, He that looks and luſts, hath committed adulterie; he that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets, hath ſtollen; he that is angrie, hath murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we ſtumble at this, and we are ſcandalized with it, and we think that other religions are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler, and that Chriſt hath dealt hardly with us, and we had rather Chriſt had not ſaid ſo, we had rather he had left us to our libertie and diſcretion, to look, and covet, and give way to our paſſions, as we ſhould finde it moſt to conduce to our eaſe and to our ends: and this is <hi>Impingere,</hi> to ſtumble, and not to go on in an equall pace, &amp; not to do the will of God cheerfully. And a ſecond degree is, <hi>Calcitrare,</hi> to kick and to ſpurn at this ſtone, to bring ſome particular ſinne and ſome particular law into compariſon, to debate thus; If I do not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10526:66"/> this now, I ſhall never have ſuch a time; if I ſlip this, I ſhall never have the like opportunitie; if I will be a fool now, I ſhall be a begger all my life; and for the law that ſhall be againſt it, there is but a little evil for a great good, and there is a great deal of time to recover and repent that little evil. Now to remove a ſtone that was a land-mark, and to hide and cover that ſtone, was all our fault in the Law: to hide the will of God from our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with excuſes and extenuations, this is <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citrare,</hi> as much as we can to ſpurn the ſtone, the land-mark out of the way: but the fulneſſe and accompliſhment of this is in the word of the text, <hi>Cadere.</hi> He falls as a piece of money into a river; we heare it fall, and we ſee it ſink, and by and by we ſee it deep, and at laſt we ſee it not at all: ſo no man falls at firſt into any ſinne, but he heares his own fall, there is a tenderneſſe in his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the beginning, at the entrance into a ſinne, and he diſcerns a while the degrees of ſinking too, but at laſt he is out of his own ſight, till he meet this ſtone, ſome hard reprehenſion, ſome hard paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of a ſermon, ſome hard judgement in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſome croſſe in the world, ſomething from the mouth, or ſomething from the hand of God, that breaks him, he falls upon this ſtone and is broken. So that to be broken upon this ſtone, is come to this ſenſe, that though our integritie be loſt, that we be no more whole and entire veſſels; yet there are means of piecing in again: though we be not veſſels of innocencie (for who is ſo? and for that, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant)</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:10526:67"/> yet we may be veſſels of repentance, acceptable to God, and uſefull to his ſervice; for when any thing falls upon a ſtone, the harm which it ſuffers is not alwayes or not onely according to the height that it falls from, and that violence that it is thrown down with. If their fall, who fall by ſinnes of infirmitie, ſhould referre onely to the ſtone they fall upon, the majeſtie of God being wounded and violated in every ſinne, every ſinner would be broken in pieces and ground to powder. But if they fall not from too farre a diſtance, if they lived within any neerneſſe, any conſideration of God, if they have not fallen with violence, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heat and force in the way, grown confident in the practiſe of their ſinnes they fall upon; if this ſtone ſink and ſtop at Chriſt, this ſhall break them, break their force and confidence, break their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and ſecuritie, but yet it ſhall leave enough in them for the holy Ghoſt to revet to his ſervice; yea, the ſinne it ſelf <hi>Cooperatur ad bonum,</hi> as the <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> Apoſtle ſayes, the very fall it ſelf ſhall be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of riſing: And therefore if S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeem to venture farre, it is not too farre, when he ſayes, <hi>Audeo dicere,</hi> It is boldly ſaid, and yet I muſt ſay it, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile eſſe, cadere in aliquod manifeſtum peccatum;</hi> A ſinner falls into his advantage, that falls into ſome ſuch ſinne, as he being manifeſted to the world, manifeſts his own ſinfull ſtate to his ſinfull conſcience too; it is well for that man that falls ſo, as that he may thereby look the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his footing ever after: <hi>Dicit Dominus, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor</hi>

                     <hi>meus es tu,</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Bernard;</hi> That man hath a new title to God, a new name for God. All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayeth) enlarge this meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can ſay, <hi>Creator meus es tu, Thou giveſt me meat in due ſeaſon;</hi> all men can ſay, <hi>Redemptor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us es tu, Thou art my Redeemer:</hi> but onely he which is fallen, and fallen upon this ſtone, can ſay, <hi>Suſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptor meus es tu;</hi> onely he who hath been overcome by a temptation, and is reſtored, can ſay, Lord thou haſt ſupported me, thou haſt recollected my ſhivers, and reveted me; onely to him hath this ſtone expreſſed both abilities of ſtone; firſt, to break him with a ſenſe of his ſinne, and then to give him reſt and peace upon it. Now there is in this part this circumſtance more, <hi>Quicunque cadit, Whoſoever falls;</hi> where the <hi>Quicunque</hi> is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque; Whoſoever falls,</hi> that is, <hi>Whoſoever he be, he falls: Quomodo cecidiſti de coelo Lucifer?</hi> ſayes <note place="margin">Iſa. 14. 12.</note> the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> the Prophet wonders how <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſhould fall, having no bodie to tempt him, for ſo many of the Ancients interpret that place, of the fall of the Angels; and when the Angels fell, there were no other creatures made: but <hi>Quid eſt homo, aut filius hominis?</hi> Since the father of man, Adam, could not, how ſhould the ſonnes of man, which inherit his weakneſſe, and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more, contribute their temptations to another, hope to ſtand? Adam fell, and he fell <hi>à longè,</hi> afarre off, for he could ſee no ſtone to fall upon, when he fell; their Meſſias was no ſuch Meſſias, no ſuch means of reparation propoſed or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10526:68"/> promiſed: when he fell, the bleſſed Virgin, and the fore-runner of Chriſt, John Baptiſt, fell too; but they fell <hi>propè,</hi> neare hand, they fell but a little way, for they had this ſtone in a perſonall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and their faith was alway awake in them; but yet he and ſhe and they all fell into ſome ſinne: <hi>Quicunque cadit,</hi> is, <hi>

                  <p>We muſt end onely with touching upon the <note place="margin">III Part.</note> third part, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom this ſtone falls, it will grinde him to powder:</hi> where we ſhall onely tell you, <hi>Quid conteri,</hi> what this grinding is; and then, <hi>Quid ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> what the falling of this ſtone is. And briefly, this grinding to powder is, to be brought to that deſperate and irrevocable eſtate in ſinne, as that no medicinall correction from God, no breaking, no bowing, no melting, no mending can bring him to any good faſhion: when God can work no cure, do no good upon us by breaking us, not by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10526:68"/> us in our healths (for we will attribute that to weakneſſe of ſtomack, to ſurfet in digeſtion) not by breaking us in our eſtates (for we will impute that to falſhood in ſervants, to oppreſſion of great adverſaries, to iniquitie of judges) not by breaking us in our honours (for we will accuſe for that, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and practiſes and ſupplications in court) when God cannot break us with his corrections, but that we will attribute them to ſome naturall, ſome accidentall cauſes, and never think of Gods judgements which are the true cauſes of theſe afflictions: when God cannot break us by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our backs, by laying an heavie load of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon us; nor by breaking our hearts, by putting us into a ſad and heavie, but fruitleſſe ſorrow and melancholie, for theſe worldly loſſes: then he comes to break us by breaking our necks, by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us into the bottomleſſe pit, and falling upon us there in his wrath and indignation. <hi>Comprimam eos in pulverem,</hi> ſayes <hi>David, I will beat them as duſt before the winde, and tread them as flat as the clay in the ſtreet;</hi> and the breaking thereof ſhall be as the breaking of a <hi>potters veſſell,</hi> which is broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pitie, no pitie from God, nor ſhall any pitie them: the Prophet ſaith further, <hi>There is not found</hi>

                     <hi>a ſheard to take fire from the hearth,</hi> but uncapable of one drop of Chriſts bloud from heaven, or of any teare of contrition in themſelves; <hi>not a ſheard to fetch water at the pit. I will break them as a potters</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 19. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>veſſell, Quod non poteſt inſtaurari,</hi> ſayes God in <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> There ſhall be no poſſible means (of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10526:69"/> thoſe means which God hath ordained in his Church) to recompact them again, no voice of Gods word ſhall draw them, no threatning of Gods judgements ſhall drive them, no cenſure of Gods Church ſhall fit them, no ſacrament ſhall cement and glue them to Chriſts bodie again: in temporall bleſſings he ſhall be unthankfull, in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall afflictions he ſhall be obdurate; and theſe two ſhall ſerve as the upper and neather milſtone, and ſo ſhall grinde the reprobate ſinner to powder.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this is to be done by falling upon him; and what is that? I know ſome expoſitours take it to be but the falling of Gods judgements upon him in this world: there is no grinding to powder: All Gods judgements here (for any thing we can know) have the nature of phyſick in them; and no man is here ſo abſolutely broken in pieces, but that he may be reunited. We chooſe to follow the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in this, that the falling of the ſtone upon the reprobate, is Chriſts laſt and irrevocable falling upon him in his laſt judgement, that when he ſhall wiſh that the hills might fall and cover him, this ſtone ſhall fall and grinde him to powder. <hi>He ſhall be broken, and be no more found,</hi> ſayes the Prophet <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Daniel:</hi> yea, he ſhall be broken, and be no more ſought, no man ſhall conſider him what he is now, or what he was before; for that ſtone which in <hi>Daniel</hi> was cut out without the hand, which was a figure of Chriſt, who came without ordinarie generation, when that great image was to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10526:69"/> broke not an arm or leg, but the whole image in pieces; and it wrought not onely upon the weak parts, but it broke all the clay and the iron, the braſſe, the ſilver, the gold: ſo when a ſtone falls thus, when Chriſt comes to judgement, he ſhall not onely condemne him for his clay, his earthly covetous ſinnes; not for his iron, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull and oppreſſing and ruſtie ſinnes; nor for his braſſe, his ſhining and gliſtering ſinnes, which he hath filed and poliſhed: but he ſhall fall upon his ſilver, his gold, his religious, his precious ſinnes, his hypocriticall hearing of ſermons, his Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call giving of alms, and aſwell his ſubtil counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting of religion, as his Atheiſticall oppoſing of religion: this ſtone Chriſt himſelf ſhall fall upon him, and a ſhowre of other ſtones ſhall oppreſſe him. <hi>Sicut pluit laqueos,</hi> ſayes <hi>David,</hi> As God rained ſnares and ſprings upon them in this world, abundance of temporall bleſſings, to be occaſions of ſinne unto them; ſo <hi>pluet grandinem,</hi> he ſhall rain ſuch hail-ſtones upon them, as ſhall grinde them to powder: there ſhall fall upon him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall law, which was written in his heart, and did rebuke him when he prepared for a ſinne; there ſhall fall upon him that written law which cried out from the mouthes of the Prophets in theſe places to avert them from ſinne; there ſhall fall upon him thoſe ſinnes that he hath done, and thoſe ſinnes which he hath not done, if nothing but want of opportunitie and means hinder him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; there ſhall fall upon him theſe ſinnes
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10526:70"/> which he hath done after anothers dehortation, &amp; thoſe which another hath done after his provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there the ſtones of Nineve ſhall fall upon him, and of as many cities as have repented, with leſſe proportions of mercie and grace then God afforded him; there the rubbiſh of Sodom and Gomorrah ſhall fall upon him, and as manie cities as their ruine might have been example to him: all thoſe ſtones ſhall fall upon him; and, to adde weight to theſe, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf ſhall fall upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with unanſwerable queſtions, and grinde his ſoul to powder: but <hi>He that overcometh, his ſoul</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 2. 11</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall not be hurt by the ſecond death.</hi> He that comes to remorſes early and earneſtly after a ſinne, and ſeeks by ordinarie means his reconciliation to God in his Church, is in the beſt eſtate that man can be in now: for howſoever we can ſay now, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is as happie an eſtate as innocencie; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly every man feels more comfort and ſpirituall joy after a true repentance for a ſinne, then he had in that degree of innocencie which he had before he committed that ſinne: and therefore in this caſe alſo we may eaſily repeat thoſe words of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, Audeo dicere,</hi> I dare be bold to ſay, that many a man hath been the better for ſome ſinne. Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, who hath given us civil wiſdome to make uſe of our enemies, give us alſo this heavenly wiſdome to make that uſe of our particular ſinnes, that thereby our wretched condition in our ſelves, and our means of reparation in Chriſt Jeſus, may be manifeſted unto us: To whom, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>In handling then this judgement, which is a word that embraces and comprehends all, all from our election, where no merit, no future acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ours were conſidered by God to our fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and poſſeſſion of that election, where all our accounts ſhall be conſidered and recompenſed by him, we ſhall ſee firſt, that judgement belongs properly to God; and ſecondly, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom we conſider to be the root and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Deitie, can no more diveſt his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then he can his godhead; and therefore in the third place we conſider, what that committing of judgement, which is mentioned here, imports; and then, to whom it is committed, to the Sonne; and laſtly, the largeneſſe of that commiſſion, <hi>Omne, All judgement,</hi> ſo that we cannot carrie our thoughts ſo high or ſo farre backwards, as to think of any judgement given upon us in Gods purpoſe or decree, without relation to Chriſt; nor ſo farre forwards, as to think there ſhall be a judgement given upon us, according to our good morall diſpoſitions or actions, but according to our apprehenſion and imitation of Chriſt. Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a proper and inſeparable character of God; that is firſt: the Father cannot diveſt himſelf of

No attribute of God is ſo often iterated in the Scriptures, no act of God ſo often inculcated as this judge and judgement, no word concerning God ſo often repeated: but it is brought to the height in that place of the Pſalme, where we reade, <hi>God judgeth among the gods,</hi> the <note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 1.</note> Latine Church ever read it, <hi>Deus dijudicat deos, God judgeth the gods themſelves:</hi> for though God ſay of judges and magiſtrates, <hi>Ego dixi, Dii eſtis, I</hi>

And that place in the beginning of the Pſalme, many of the Ancients reade in the future, <hi>Dijudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabit, God ſhall judge the gods;</hi> becauſe the frame of the Pſalme ſeems to referre it to the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Tertullian</hi> read it <hi>Dijudicavit,</hi> as a thing paſt: God hath judged in all times, and the letter of the text requires it to be in the preſent, <hi>Dijudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.</hi> Collect all, and judgement is ſo eſſentiall to God, as that it is coeternall with him: he hath, he doth, and he will judge the world, and the judges of the world. Other judges die like men, weakly; and they fall (that is worſe) ignominiouſly; and they fall like princes (that is worſe) fearfully and ſcornfully; and when they are dead and fallen, they riſe no more to execute judgement, but to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10526:74"/> have judgement executed upon them: the Lord dies not, he falls not; and if he ſeem to ſlumber, the martyrs under the altar awake him with their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque quò, Domine?</hi> How long, O Lord, before thou execute judgement? and he will ariſe and judge the world, for judgement is his. God put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down one, and ſetteth up another, ſayes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> where hath he that power? why, God is the Judge, not a judge, but the Judge, and in that right he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</p>
                  <p>Now for this judgement which we place in God, we muſt conſider in God three notions, three apprehenſions, three kindes of judgements. Firſt, God hath <hi>Judicium deteſtationis;</hi> God doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally know, and therefore naturally deteſt all evil: for no man in the extreameſt corruption of nature is yet fallen ſo farre, as to love or approve evil, at the ſame time that he knows and acknowledges it to be evil. But we are ſo blinde in the knowledge of evil, that we needed that great ſupplement and aſſiſtance of the Law it ſelf to make us know what was evil. <hi>Moſes</hi> magnifies, and juſtly, the Law; <hi>Non appropinquavit,</hi> ſayes <hi>Moſes,</hi> God came not ſo neare to any nation as to the Jews: <hi>Non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter fecit,</hi> God dealt not ſo well with any nation as with the Jews; and wherein? becauſe he had given them a Law: and yet we ſee the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie of this Law to be, that by the Law is the <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> knowledge of ſinne; for though by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture written in our hearts, there be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of ſome ſinnes; yet to know that every ſinne was treaſon againſt God, to know that every
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10526:74"/> ſinne hath the reward of death and eternall death annexed to it, this knowledge we have onely by the Law: now if man will pretend to be a judge, what an exact knowledge of the Law is required at his hands! for ſome things are ſinnes to one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are not ſo to another; and where the juſt authorite of the lawfull Magiſtrate changes the nature of the thing, that which is naturally indifferent, is neceſſarie to them who are under his obedience: ſome things are ſinnes at one time, which are not ſo at another, as all the ceremoniall Law created new ſinnes, which were not ſinnes before that Law was given, nor ſince it expired: ſome things are ſinnes in a man now, which will not be ſinnes in the ſame man to morrow; as when a man hath contracted a juſt ſcruple againſt any particular action, it is a ſinne to do it during the ſcruple; and it may be a ſinne in him to omit it, when he hath digeſted the ſcruple. Onely God hath <hi>Judicium deteſtationis,</hi> he knows and therefore deteſts evil: and therefore flatter not thy ſoul with a Tuſh, God ſees it not; or, Tuſh, God cares not; doth it diſquiet him, or trouble his reſt in heaven, that I break his ſabbath here? doth it wound his bodie, or draw his bloud there, that I ſwear by his bodie and bloud here? doth it corrupt any of his virgins there, that I ſollicit the chaſtitie of a woman here? are his martyrs withdrawn from their allegeance, or retarded in their ſervice to him there, becauſe I dare not defend his cauſe, nor ſpeak for him, nor fight for him here? Beloved,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10526:75"/> as it is a degree of ſuperſtition, and an effect of an indiſcreet zeal perchance, to be too forward by making indifferent things neceſſarie, and ſo to imprint the nature and ſting of ſinne, where natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is not (for certainly it is a moſt ſlipperie and irreligious thing to be too apt to call things meerly indifferent, and to forget that even in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, walking and ſleeping, the glorie of God is intermingled; as if we knew exactly the preſence and foreknowledge of God, there could be nothing contingent or caſuall; for though there be a contingencie in the nature of the thing, yet it is certain to God) ſo if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider duely wherein the glorie of God might be promoted in every action of ours, there could ſcarce be any action ſo indifferent, but that the glorie of God would turn the ſcale, and make it neceſſarie to me at that time: but then private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and private reſpects create a new indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie to my apprehenſion, and call me to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that thing as it is in nature, and not as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned with the circumſtance of the glorie of God; and ſo I loſe that <hi>judicium deteſtationis,</hi> which onely God hath abſolutely and perfectly, to know, and therefore to deteſt evil. And ſo he is a Judge. As he is a Judge ſo, <hi>judicat rem,</hi> he judges the nature of a thing; he is ſo too, that he hath <hi>judicium diſcretionis,</hi> and ſo <hi>judicat perſonam:</hi> he knows what is evil, and he diſcerns when thou committeſt that evil. Here you are fain to ſupply defects of laws, that things done in our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10526:75"/> countrey may be tried in another; and that in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of high nature, tranſmarine offences might be enquired and tried here: but as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>Who hath meaſured the waters in the hollow</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>of his hand, or meted out the heavens with a ſpanne? who comprehended the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, or weighed the mountains in a ſcale?</hi> ſo I ſay, Who hath divided heaven into ſhires or pariſhes, or limited the territories or juriſdictions there, that God ſhould not have and exerciſe <hi>judicium diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> the power of diſcerning all actions in all places, when there was no more to be ſeen nor conſidered upon the whole earth, but the garden of Paradiſe? for from the beginning, <hi>Deliciae ejus eſſe cum filiis hominum, Gods delight was to be with the ſonnes of men;</hi> and man was onely there. Shall we not diminiſh God or ſpeak too vulgarly of him, to ſay that he hovered like a falcon over Paradiſe, and that from the height of heaven the piercing eye of God ſaw ſo little a thing as the forbidden fruit, and what became of that? and the reaching eare of God heard the hiſſing of the ſerpent, and the whiſpering of the woman, and what was concluded upon that? ſhall we think it little to have ſeen things done in Paradiſe, when there was nothing elſe to divert his eye, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to diſtract his counſels, nothing elſe done upon the face of the earth? take the earth now as it is repleniſhed, and take it either as it is torn and crumbled in rags and ſhivers, not a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not a family, not a man agreeing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10526:76"/> or take it in that concord which is in it, as all the kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and all the rulers of the earth take counſel together againſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 2.</note> the Lord; take it in this union, or this diſunion; in this concord, or this diſconcord; ſtill the Lord that ſitteth in the heavens diſcerns all, looks at all, laughs at all, and hath them in deriſion. Earthly judges have their diſtrictions, and ſo their reſtrictions; ſome things they cannot know: what mortall man can know all? ſome things they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take knowledge of, for they are bounded: no cloud, no darkneſſe, no diſguiſe keeps him from diſcerning and judging all our actions: and ſo he is a Judge too. And he is ſo laſtly, as he hath <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium retributionis:</hi> God knows what is evil, and he knows when that evil is done, and he knows how to puniſh and recompenſe that evil. For the office of a judge who judges according to a law, being not to contract nor to extend that law, but to know what was the true meaning of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, when he made that law; God hath this judgement in perfection, becauſe he himſelf made that Law by which he judges. When he hath ſaid, <hi>Stipendium peccati mors eſt,</hi> Every ſinne ſhall be rewarded with death; <hi>If I ſinne againſt the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 25</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, who ſhall intreat for me?</hi> who ſhall give any other interpretation, any modification, any <hi>Non obſtante</hi> upon his Law in my behalf? when he comes to judge me according to that Law which himſelf hath made, who ſhall think to delude the Judge, and ſay, Surely this was not the meaning of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10526:76"/> Law-giver, when he who is the Judge, was the Law-maker too.</p>
                  <p>And then as God is Judge in all theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſo he is a Judge in them all <hi>Sine appellatione,</hi> and <hi>Sine judiciis:</hi> man cannot appeal from God: God needs no evidence from man. For the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal firſt, to whom ſhould we appeal from the Soveraigne? wrangle as long as we will, who is chief Juſtice, and which Countie hath juriſdiction one over another? I know the chief Juſtice, and I know the Soveraigne court; the King of heaven and earth ſhall ſend his miniſtring ſpirits, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to the wombe and bowels of the earth, and to the boſome and bottome of the ſea, and earth and ſea ſhall deliver <hi>Corpus cum cauſa,</hi> all the bodies of the dead, and all their actions, to receive a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his court; when it will be an erroneous and frivolous appeal to call to the hills to fall down upon us, and to the mountains to cover and hide us from the wrathfull judgement of God.</p>
                  <p>He is Judge then, <hi>Sine appellatione,</hi> Without any appeal from him; he is ſo too <hi>Sine judiciis,</hi> Without any evidence from us. Now if I be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in my actions here, incarnate devils, detractours and informers cannot accuſe me: if my ſinne come not into action, but lie onely in my heart, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf, who is the Accuſer of the brethren, hath no evidence againſt me.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10526:78"/> then the Father judgeth ſtill, but he judges as God, and not as the Father. In the three great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, the whole Trinitie judges. In the firſt judgement before all times, which was Gods judiciarie ſeparating of veſſels of honour from veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of diſhonour, in our election and reprobation; In his ſecond judgement, which is in execution now, which is Gods judiciarie ſeparating of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from enemies, in the ſeals and in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Chriſtian Church; And in the laſt judgement, which ſhall be Gods judiciarie ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſheep from goats to everlaſting glorie or condemnation: In all theſe three judgements all the three perſons of the Trinitie are Judges. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God all together, and ſo in all outward works all the Trinitie concurres, becauſe all are but one God: but conſider God in relation, in diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo the ſeverall perſons of the Trinitie do ſome things which the other perſons of the Trinitie are not intereſſed in: the Sonne had not generation from himſelf, ſo as he had from the Father; and the holy Ghoſt, as a diſtinct perſon, had none at all; the holy Ghoſt had a proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, but from the Sonne a perſon, who had his generation from another, but not ſo from the Father. Not to ſtray into clouds or perplexities in the contemplation, God, that is, the whole Trinitie, judges ſtill; but ſo as the Sonne judgeth, the Father judgeth not, for that judgement he hath committed. That we may husband our houre as well, and reſcribe as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10526:78"/> much as we can for our two laſt conſiderations, the <hi>Cui</hi> and the <hi>Quid,</hi> To whom, and that is to the Sonne; and what he hath committed, and that is all judgement; we will not ſtand much upon this, more needs not then this, that God in his wiſdome foreſeeing that man by his weakneſſe would not be able to ſettle himſelf upon the conſideration of God and his judgements, as they are meerly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heavenly, out of his abundant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath eſtabliſhed a judgement, and ordained a judge upon earth like himſelf, and like our ſelves too: that as no man hath ſeen God, ſo no man ſhould go about to ſee his unſearchable decrees &amp; judgements, but reſt in thoſe ſenſible and viſible means which he hath afforded, that is, Chriſt Jeſus ſpeaking in his Church, and applying his bloud unto us in the ſacraments unto the worlds end. God might have ſuffered <hi>Abraham</hi> to reſt in the firſt generall promiſe, <hi>Semen mulieris, The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpents head:</hi> but he would bring it nearer to a viſible, to a perſonall covenant, <hi>In ſemine tuo, In thy ſeed ſhall all nations be bleſſed:</hi> he might well have let him reſt in that appropriation of his promiſe to his race; but he would proceed further, and ſeal it with a ſenſible ſeal in his fleſh, with circumciſion. He might have let him reſt in that ratification, that a Meſſias ſhould come by that way: but he would refreſh it by a continuall ſucceſſion of Prophets till the Meſſias ſhould come. And now that he is come and gone, ſtill God purſues the ſame way, <hi>How</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:10526:79"/> 
                     <hi>ſhould they beleeve except they heare?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God evermore ſupplies his Church with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſenſible means, and knowing that the naturall inclination of man, who when he cannot have or cannot comprehend the originall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype, deſires to ſatisfie and refreſh himſelf with a picture and repreſentation: ſo, though God hath forbidden us that ſlipperie, frivolous, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous uſe of graven images; yet he hath afforded us his Sonne, who is the image of the inviſible God, and ſo more proportionall to us, more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by us: and ſo this committing is no more but that God (in another form then that of God) hath manifeſted his power of judging. And this committing, this manifeſting, is <hi>In Filio, In his Sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in our entrance into the handling of this, we ask onely this queſtion, <hi>Cui Filio?</hi> To which Sonne of God is this commiſſion given? not that God hath more ſonnes then one, but becauſe that one Sonne is his Sonne by a twofold filiation; by an internall and expreſſible generation, and by a temporarie and miraculous incarnation: in which of theſe rights is this commiſſion derived upon him? doth he judge as he is the Sonne of God, or as he is the ſonne of man? I am not ordinarily bold in determining points (eſpecially if they were fundamentall) wherein I finde the Fathers among themſelves, and the School in it ſelf, and reverend Divines of the Reformation amongſt themſelves to differ: But yet neither am I willing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10526:79"/> to raiſe doubts, and leave the auditorie unſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unſettled. We are not upon a lecture, but upon a ſermon, and therefore we will not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply varietie of opinions. Summe up the Fathers upon one ſide in S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> mouth, and they will ſay with him, <hi>Deditutique generando, non largiendo,</hi> God gave his Sonne this commiſſion then, and when was that then? then when he begat him, and then he muſt have it by his eternall generation, as the Sonne of God. Summe up the Fathers now on the other ſide in S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> mouth, and there they will ſay with him, that it is ſo cleare and ſo certain, that whatſoever is ſaid in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be committed or given to Chriſt, belongs to Chriſt as the ſonne of man, and not as the Sonne of God, as that the other opinion cannot be maintained, and at this diſtance we ſhall never bring them to meet: but take in this rule, <hi>Judicium convenit ei ut homo, cauſa ut Deus;</hi> God hath given this commiſſion to Chriſt as man; but Chriſt had not been capable of this commiſſion, if he had not been God too: and ſo it is eaſily to be reconciled. If we ſhall hold ſimply to the letter of the text, <hi>Pater dedit,</hi> then it will ſeem to be committed unto him in his eternall generation, becauſe that was a work of the Father onely, and in that generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Ghoſt had no part: but ſince in this judgement which is now committed to him, the holy Ghoſt hath a part; (for, as we ſaid before, the judgement is an act of the whole Trinitie) and that is as he is man; for, <hi>Tota Trinitas univit</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:10526:80"/> 
                     <hi>humanitatem,</hi> the hypoſtaticall union of God and man, in the perſon of Chriſt, was a work of the whole Trinitie.</p>
                  <p>Taking it then ſo ſettled, that the capacitie of this judgement, and (if we may ſay ſo) the future title to it, was given to him as God, by his eſſence, in his eternall generation, by which <hi>Non vitae parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps, ſed vita naturaliter eſt,</hi> We cannot ſay that Chriſt hath life, but that he is Life, and the Life; for whatſover the Father is, He is, excepting one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name and relation of Father; the capacitie, the abilitie is in him eternally, before any imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, any poſſible conſideration of time. But the power of the actuall execution of this judgement, which is given and is committed, is in him as man; becauſe, as the ſame father ſayes, <hi>Ad hominem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur, Quid habes quod non accepiſti?</hi> when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> he asks that queſtion of man; that which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is received as man. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in a place where he diſpoſes himſelf to quarrell at ſome form of words of <hi>Calvins,</hi> though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the matter to be true, and (as he calls it there) Catholick, ſayes, <hi>Eſſentiam genitam negamus,</hi> We confeſſe that Chriſt hath not his eſſence from his Father by generation. The relation and filiation he hath from his Father; he hath the name of Sonne, but he hath not the execution of this judgement, by that relation, by that filiation: ſtill as he is the Sonne of God, he hath that capacitie; as the ſonne of man, he hath the execution. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10526:80"/> therefore <hi>Proſper,</hi> that follows S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> limits it (perchance too narrowly) to the fleſh, to the humanitie; <hi>Ipſa, non ipſe, erit Judex, quae ſub judice ſtetit; &amp; ipſa judicabit, quae judicata eſt:</hi> where he places not this judgement upon the mixt perſon (which is the ſafeſt way) of God and man, but upon man alone. <hi>God hath appointed a day in which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 17. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe;</hi> but by whom? <hi>By that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> God will judge ſtill, but ſtill in Chriſt: and therefore ſayes S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>Ariſe O God</hi>

                     <hi>things are delivered me of my Father.</hi> Now all this our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus exerciſes either <hi>Per car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:10526:81"/> or at the leaſt <hi>In carne;</hi> whatſoever the Father does, the Sonne does alſo <hi>In carne,</hi> becauſe now there is an inſeparable union between God and humane nature: the Father creates new ſouls every day in the inanimation of children, and the Sonne creates them with him. The Father concurres with all ſecond cauſes, as the firſt moving cauſe of all in naturall things. And all this the Sonne doth too, but this is <hi>In carne;</hi> though he be in our humane fleſh, he is not the leſſe able to do the acts belonging to the godhead: but <hi>Per carnem,</hi> by the fleſh inſtrumentally he executes judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the ſonne of man. God hath been ſo indulgent to man, as that there ſhould be no judgement given upon man, but man ſhould give it.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt then having all judgement, or (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh your memories) thoſe three judgements which we touched upon before, firſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our election, ſevering of veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſhonour; next, the judgement of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication here, ſevering friends from enemies; and then the judgement of glorification, ſevering the ſheep from the goats: and for the firſt, of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as if I were under the condemnation of the Law for ſome capitall offence, and going to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the kings mercie expreſſed in a ſealed pardon were preſented me, I ſhould not ſtand to enquire what moved the king to do it, what he ſaid to any bodie elſe, what any bodie elſe ſaid to him, what he ſaw in me, or what he looked for at
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10526:81"/> my hands; but embrace that mercie cheerfully and thankfully, and attribute it onely to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant goodneſſe: ſo when I conſider my ſelf to have been let fall into this world, <hi>In maſſa damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> under the generall condemnation of mankinde, and yet by the working of Gods Spirit I finde at firſt a deſire, and after a modeſt aſſurance, that I am delivered from that condemnation; I enquire not what God did in his bed-chamber, in his cabinet-counſel, in his eternall decree; I know that he hath made <hi>Judicium electionis</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore that I may know whether I do not deceive my ſelf, in preſuming my ſelf to be of that number, I come down and examine my ſelf, whether I can truely tell my conſcience that Chriſt Jeſus died for me; which I cannot do, if I have not a deſire and endeavour to conform my ſelf unto him: and if I do that, there I finde my predeſtination, I am a Chriſtian, and I will not offer before my maſter Chriſt Jeſus: I cannot be ſaved before there was a Saviour; in Chriſt Jeſus is <hi>omne judicium, all judgement;</hi> and therefore the judgement of election, the firſt ſeparating of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of honour and diſhonour, in election and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, was Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Much more evidently is the ſecond judgement of our juſtification, by means ordained in the Chriſtian Church, the judgement of Chriſt. It is the Goſpel of Chriſt which is preached unto you there, it is the bloud of Chriſt which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto you there; there is no other name
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10526:82"/> given under heaven whereby you may be ſaved, there are no other means given wherein ſalvation ſhould be applied in his name, but thoſe which he hath inſtituted in his Church: ſo that when I come to the ſecond judgement, to trie whether I ſtand juſtified in the ſight of God or no, I come for that judgement to Chriſt in his Church. Do I remember what I contracted with Chriſt Jeſus, when I took the name of a Chriſtian at my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church by Baptiſme? do I finde that I have endeavoured to perform thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? do I finde remorſe when I have not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them? do I ſeek the meſſage of remiſſion of ſinnes, from the mouth of his miniſter? have I a true and ſound conſolation without ſhift, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, or flattering of my conſcience, when I receive the ſeal of his pardon in the ſacrament? Beloved, not in any morall integritie, not in keeping the conſcience of an honeſt man in generall, but in uſing well the means ordained by Chriſt in the Chriſtian Church, am I juſtified: and therefore this judgement of juſtification is his too.</p>
                  <p>And then the third and laſt judgement, which is the judgement of glorification, that is eaſily agreed by all, that it appertains to Chriſt. <hi>Idem Jeſus,</hi> The ſame Jeſus that aſcended, ſhall come to judgement: <hi>Videbunt quem pupugerunt. Every</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him.</hi> Then the ſonne of man ſhall come in glorie, &amp; he as man ſhall give the judgement for things done or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards him as man, for not feeding, for not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10526:82"/> clothing, for not harbouring, for not viſiting. The ſumme of all is, that this is the overflowing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, that he deals with man by the ſonne of man, and that he hath ſo given all judgement to the Sonne, as that if you would be tried by the firſt judgement, Are you elected or no? the iſſue is, do you beleeve in Chriſt, or no? if you would be tried by the ſecond judgement, Are you juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or no? the iſſue is, do you finde comfort in the application of the word and ſacraments of Chriſt Jeſus, or no? If you would be tried by the third judgement, Do you expect a glorification or no? the iſſue is, are you ſo reconciled to Chriſt Jeſus now by heartie repentance for ſinnes paſt, and by a deteſtation of occaſions of future ſinnes, that you durſt welcome that Angel that ſhould come at this time, and ſwear that time ſhould be no more, that your tranſmigration out of this world ſhould be this minute, and that this minute you could ſay unfeignedly and effectually, <hi>Veni Domine Jeſu, Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> come now? If this be your ſtate, then are you partakers of all that bleſſedneſſe which the Father intended to you, when for your ſakes he committed all judgement to the Sonne.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He rivers of Paradiſe did not all runne one way, and yet they flowed from one head. The ſentences of the Scripture flow all from one head, from the holy Ghoſt, and yet they ſeem to preſent divers ſenſes, and to admit divers interpretations: in ſuch an appearance doth the text differ from that which I handled in the morning. And as heretofore I found it an uſuall and acceptable labour, to employ our evening exerciſes upon the vindicating of ſuch places of Scripture, as our adverſaries of the Romane Church had detorted in ſome points of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between them and us, and reſtoring thoſe places to their true ſenſe (which courſe I held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for one whole yeare) ſo I think it an uſuall and acceptable labour now, to employ for a time theſe evening exerciſes, to reconcile ſome ſuch places of Scripture as may at firſt ſight ſeem to differ one from another. In the morning we ſaw
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10526:85"/> how Chriſt judged all; now we are to ſee how he judgeth none, <hi>I judge no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come then to theſe preſent words, here we have the ſame perſon Chriſt Jeſus; and hath he not the ſame office? is not he Judge? certainly though he retain all his other offices, though he be the Redeemer, and hath ſhed bloud, in value ſatisfactorie for all our ſinnes; though he be our Advocate and plead for us in heaven, and preſent our evidence to that kingdome, written in his bloud, ſealed in his wounds: yet if he be not our Judge, we cannot ſtand in judgement. Shall he be our Judge, and is he not our Judge yet? long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were, he was our Judge, at the ſeparation of the elect and reprobate in Gods eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: was he our Judge then, and is he not ſtill? ſtill he is preſent in his Church, and cleares us in all ſcruples, rectifies us in all errours, erects us in all dejections of ſpirit, pronounces peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in all apprehenſions of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by his word, by his ſacraments: was he, and is he, and ſhall he not be our Judge ſtill? <hi>I am</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 19. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>ſure my Redemer liveth, and he ſhall ſtand at the laſt day on the earth;</hi> ſo that Chriſt Jeſus is the ſame to day, and yeſterday, and for ever, before the world began, and world without end; <hi>ſicut erat in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> as he was in the beginning, he is, and ſhall be ever our Judge.</p>
                  <p>So that then theſe words are not <hi>de tempore,</hi> but <hi>de modo:</hi> there was never any time when Chriſt was not Judge; but there were ſome manner of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10526:85"/> judgements, which Chriſt did never exerciſe. And Chriſt had no commiſſion which he did not execute, for he did all his Fathers will. Firſt, <hi>In ſecularibus,</hi> in civil and criminall buſineſſes, which belong meerly to the judicature and cogniſance of the world, <hi>Judicat neminem,</hi> Chriſt judges no man. Secondly, <hi>Secundum carnem,</hi> ſo as they to whom Chriſt ſpoke this, who judged (as himſelf ſayes here) according to fleſhly affections, <hi>Judicat neminem,</hi> He judges no man. And thirdly, <hi>Ad internecionem,</hi> ſo as that upon that judgement a man ſhould deſpair of any reconciliation, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dintegration with God again, and be without hope of pardon or remiſſion of ſinnes in this world, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat neminem,</hi> He judges no man. Firſt, Chriſt uſurps upon no mans juriſdictions; that were againſt juſtice. Secondly, he imputes no falſe things to any man; that were againſt charitie. Thirdly, Chriſt induces no man to deſperation; that were againſt faith: and againſt juſtice, againſt charitie, againſt faith, <hi>Judicat neminem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then, Chriſt judges not in ſecular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>I</label> and we note his abſence therein, firſt in civil matters. When one of the companie ſaid unto him, <hi>Maſter, bid my brother divide the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with me,</hi> (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes) the partie thought his cauſe to be juſt, and he thought Chriſt to be a competent Judge in the cauſe; yet Chriſt declines the judgement, diſavows the authoritie, and he anſwers, <hi>Homo, quis me conſtituit judicem?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Man, who made me a judge between you two?</hi> That
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10526:86"/> generall which we had in the morning, <hi>Omne ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi> The Sonne hath all judgement, here is an exception of the ſame Judges making: for in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular judgement <hi>Nemo conſtituit,</hi> He had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and therefore <hi>Judicat neminem,</hi> He judges no man: he forbore in civil, he forbore in crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall matters too. For when the woman taken in adulterie was brought before him, he condemned her not: he undertook no office of a Judge, but of a ſweet and ſpirituall counſellour, <hi>Go and ſinne no more;</hi> for this was his element, his tribunall.</p>
                  <p>When then Chriſt ſayes of himſelf with ſuch a pregnant negative, <hi>Quis me conſtituit judicem?</hi> may not we ſay ſo too, to his pretended Vicar the Biſhop of Rome? <hi>Quis te?</hi> Who made you a judge of kings, and that you ſhould depoſe them in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall cauſes? or who made you proprietour of kingdomes, that you ſhould diſpoſe of them as of civil inheritance? when to countenance ſuch a pretence, they detort places of Scripture not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverſly, but ſenſeleſly, blaſphemouſly, and ridiculouſly (as ridiculouſly as in their paſquils) when in an undiſcreet ſhameleſneſſe, to make their power greater then it is, they make their fault greater then it is too, and fill their hiſtories with kings depoſed by Popes, which in truth were not depoſed by them (for in that they are more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent then they confeſſe themſelves) when ſome of their authours ſay that the Primitive Church abſtained from depoſing of the Emperours, onely becauſe ſhe was not ſtrong enough to do it; when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10526:86"/> ſome of them ſay that all the Chriſtian kingdomes of the earth may fall into the Church of Rome by faults in thoſe princes; when ſome of them ſay that <hi>de facto</hi> the Pope hath alreadie a good title to every Chriſtian kingdome; when ſome of them ſay the world will never be well governed till the Pope himſelf puts himſelf in poſſeſſion of all (all which ſeverall propoſitions are in ſeverall authours of good reputation amongſt them) will he not endure Chriſts own queſtion, <hi>Quis to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituit?</hi> Who made you a judge of all this? if they ſay Chriſt did, did he it in his doctrine? it is hard to pretend that: for ſuch an inſtitution as that muſt have very cleare, very pregnant words to carrie it. Did he do it by his example and practiſe? we ſee he abſtained in civil, he abſtained in criminall cauſes. When they come to their laſt ſhift, that Chriſt did exerciſe judiciarie authoritie, when he whipt merchants out of the temple, when he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the fig-tree, and damnified the owner thereof, when he deſtroyed the herd of ſwine (for there, ſay they, the devil was but the executioner, Chriſt was the Judge) to all theſe and ſuch as theſe, it is enough to ſay all theſe were miraculous and not ordinarie: and though it might ſeem half a miracle, how that Biſhops ſhould exerciſe ſo much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie as he hath done, over the world; yet when we look nearer, and ſee his means that he hath done all this by, by maſſacres, &amp; that of millions, by withdrawing ſubjects from their allegeance, by aſſaſſinating and murdering of princes; when we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10526:87"/> know that miracles are without means, and we ſee the means of his proceedings, the miracle ceaſeth: howſoever that Biſhop, as Chriſts Vicar, can claim no other power then was ordinarie in Chriſt, and ſo exerciſed by Chriſt; and ſo <hi>Judicat neminem,</hi> In ſecular judgement Chriſt judges no man; and therefore that Biſhop, as his Vicar, ſhould not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt judges no man by calumnie, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>II</label> by imputing or laying falſe aſperſions upon him, nor true things extrajudicially: for that is a degree of calumnie, and ſlander, and detraction, ſo large a field, as that we may fight out the laſt drop of our bloud, preach out the laſt gaſp of our breath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we overcome it. Thoſe to whom Chriſt ſpoke here, were ſuch as gave perverſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and calumniated the cenſures upon him; and ſo he judges no man: we need not inſiſt upon that, for it is <hi>manifeſtè verum:</hi> but that we may ſee our danger and our dutie, what calumnie is, and ſee how to avoid it actively, and how to bear it paſſively, I muſt by your leave ſtop a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p>When we would preſent to you that monſter, ſlander and calumnie, though it be hard to bring it within any compaſſe of a diviſion, yet to take the largeneſſe of the School, and ſay that every calumnie is either direct or indirect, that will comprehend all; and then a direct calumnie will have three branches; Either to lay a falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt imputation; Or elſe to aggravate a juſt imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with unneceſſarie, but heavie circumſtances;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10526:87"/> Or thirdly, to reveal a fault which in it ſelf was ſecret, and I by no dutie bound to diſcover it. And then the indirect calumnie will have three branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es too; Either to deny expreſſely ſome good that is in another; Or to ſmother it in ſilence, when my teſtimonie were due to him, and might advantage him; Or laſtly, to diminiſh his good parts, and ſay they are well, but not ſuch as the world eſteems them to be. Collect them again (for that is all we are able to do) that he is a direct calumniatour, that imputes a falſe crime, that aggravateth a true crime, that diſcovers any crime extrajudicially; That he is an indirect calumniatour, that denies another mans ſufficiencies, that conceals them, that diminiſhes them. Take in ſome of S. <hi>Bernards</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of theſe rules, that it is a calumnie to ſay, <hi>Doleo vehementer,</hi> I am ſorie at the heart for ſuch a man, becauſe I love him, but I would never draw him from ſuch and ſuch vice; or to ſay, <hi>Per me nunquam innotuiſſet,</hi> I ſhould never have ſpoken of it; yet ſince all the world talks of it, the truth muſt not be diſguiſed; and ſo take occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a fault which no bodie knew before, and thereby, as the ſame Father ſayes, <hi>Cum gravamine &amp; tarditate aggredi maledictionem,</hi> to cut a mans throat gravely and ſoberly, and ſo much the more perſwaſively, becauſe he ſeems and pretends to do it all againſt his will. This being the rule, and this being the example, who amongſt us is free from the paſſive calumnie? whom amongſt us hath not ſome other man calumniated? nay, who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10526:88"/> is free from the active part? which of us hath not in ſome of theſe degrees calumniated ſome other?</p>
                  <p>But thoſe of whom Chriſt makes this exception here, that he judges no man as they judge, were ſuch calumniatours as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Sedens adverſus fratrem tuum loquebaris, Thou ſateſt and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 20</note> 
                     <hi>ſpakeſt againſt thy neighbour:</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> notes upon that place, <hi>Non tranſitoriè, non ſurreptionis paſsione, ſed quaſi ad hoc vacans;</hi> Not by chance and unawares, not in paſſion, becauſe he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee; not for companie, becauſe thou wouldſt be of their mindes, but as though thy profeſſion would bear thee out in it, to leave the cauſe, and lay an aſperſion upon the perſon, ſo thou art a calumniatour. <hi>They eat up my people like</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 53. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>bread,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſayes in Gods perſon: and upon thoſe words of the ſame Prophet, ſayes the ſame Father, <hi>De caeteris,</hi> When we eat of any thing elſe, we taſte of this diſh, and we taſte of that. <hi>Non ſemper hoc olus,</hi> ſayes he; We do not alwayes eat of one ſallet, one meat, one kinde of fruit; <hi>ſed ſemper panem;</hi> whatſoever we eat elſe, we eat bread: howſoever they employed their thoughts or their wits otherwiſe, it was ever one exerciſe of them to calumniate Chriſt Jeſus. And in that kinde of calumnie, which is the bittereſt of all, they abounded moſt, which is, in ſcorn and deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> who were ſlander-proof in a good meaſure, yet every where complain paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, that they were made a ſcorn, that the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10526:88"/> wits made libels, that drunkards ſung ſongs, that fools and children of fools derided them: and when <hi>Saul</hi> was in his laſt, but worſt agonie, and had abandoned himſelf to a preſent death, and prayed his armour-bearer to kill him, it was not becauſe the uncircumciſed ſhould not kill him, for he deſired death, and he had their deadly arrows alreadie in his boſome; but it was (as it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there) leſt the uncircumciſed ſhould come and abuſe him; he was afraid of ſcorn, when he had but a few minutes of life. Since then Chriſt judgeth no man, as they did, <hi>Secundum carnem,</hi> neither <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum carnem ejus,</hi> according to the outward appearance (for they thought no better of Chriſt then he ſeemed to be (as ſome Fathers take that phraſe) <hi>Nec ſecundum carnem ſuam,</hi> nor according to his own fleſhly paſſions, as ſome others take it; judge not you neither. Firſt, <hi>Judge not that ye be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>not judged,</hi> that is, (as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> interprets it well enough) <hi>Nolite judicare de judiciis Dei,</hi> When you ſee Gods judgements fall upon a man, do not you judge that that man ſinned more then you; when you ſee another man born blinde, do not you think that he or his father had ſinned, and that you are onely derived from a pure generation; eſpecially <hi>Non maledicas ſurdo, Speak not evil of the deaf that</hi>

It is the devils office to be <hi>Accuſator fratrum:</hi> and though God do not ſay in the Law, <hi>Non erit,</hi> yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10526:89"/> he ſayes, <hi>Non eris criminator;</hi> It is not plainly, <hi>There ſhall be no informer:</hi> for as we diſpute, and <note place="margin">Levit. 19. 16</note> for the moſt part affirm in the School, that though we could, we may deſtroy no entire <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the creatures which God made at firſt, though it were a tiger or a viper, becauſe this were to take one link of Gods chain out of the world; ſo ſuch vermin as informers, may not for ſome good uſe that is of them be taken away: though it be not, <hi>Non erit, There ſhall be none;</hi> yet it is at leaſt by way of good counſel to thee, <hi>Non eris,</hi> Thou ſhalt not be the man, thou ſhalt not be the informer: and for reſiſting thoſe that are, we are bound, not onely not to burn our neighbours houſe, but to help him, if caſually his houſe fall on fire: we are bound, where we have authoritie, to ſtop the mouthes of other calumniatours; where we have no authoritie, yet (ſince <hi>as the north winde driveth</hi>

Alwayes remember <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, when he thought he had been giving judgement againſt another, he was more ſevere, more heavie then the law admitted: the Law was, that he that had ſtolen the ſheep, ſhould reſtore fourefold; <hi>And Davids anger was kindled,</hi> ſayes the <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 5.</note> text, <hi>and he ſwore, As the Lord liveth, that man ſhall reſtore fourefold: Et filius mortis,</hi> and he ſhall ſurely die. <hi>O judicis effluentem juſtitiam!</hi> O ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10526:89"/> and overflowing juſtice, when we judge another in paſſion! But this is <hi>Judicium ſecundum carne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> according to which Chriſt judgeth no man: for Chriſt is Love, and that <hi>non cogitat malum, Love thinks no evil</hi> any way; the charitable man <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 5.</note> neither meditates evil againſt another, nor beleeves eaſily any evil to be in another, though it be told him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Chriſt judgeth no man <hi>Ad internecionem,</hi> he judges no man ſo in this world, as to give a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condemnation upon him here; there is no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in any of his judgements, but there is an appeal from all his judgements in this world, there is a verdict againſt every man; every man may finde his caſe recorded, and his ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Law; and in the Prophets there is a verdict, but before judgement God would have every man ſaved by his book, by the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and application of the gracious promiſes of the Goſpel to his caſe, and his conſcience. Chriſt judgeth no man ſo as that he ſhould ſee no remedie but to curſe God and die, nor ſo as that he ſhould ſay his ſinne were greater then God could forgive: <hi>For God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do not then give malicious evidence againſt thy ſelf, do not weaken the merit, nor leſſen the value of the bloud of thy Saviour, as though thy ſinne were greater then it is. Doth God deſire thy bloud now, when he hath abundantly ſatisfied
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10526:90"/> his juſtice with the bloud of his Sonne for thee? what haſt thou done? haſt thou come hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to this place, upon collaterall reaſons, and not upon the direct ſervice of God, not for love of information or reformation of thy ſelf? if that be thy caſe, yet, <hi>If a man will heare my word,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>and beleeve it not, I judge him not, he hath one that judgeth him;</hi> and who is that? <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him:</hi> it ſhall, but when? <hi>It ſhall judge him,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>at the laſt day:</hi> for till the laſt day, the day of his death, no man is paſt recoverie, no mans ſalvation is impoſſible. Haſt thou gone further then this? haſt thou committed ſcruples of diffidence and diſtruſt of Gods mercie, and ſo taſted of the lees of deſperation? It is true, <hi>Perpetrare flagitium, eſt mors animae; ſed deſperare, eſt deſcenſus ad inferos; In every ſinne thy ſoul dies, but in deſperation it deſcends into hell:</hi> But yet, <hi>Portae inferni non praevalebunt, The</hi>

                     <hi>gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt thee.</hi> Aſſiſt thy ſelf, argue thine own caſe; deſperation it ſelf may be without infidelitie, deſperation as well as hope is rooted in the deſire of happineſſe. Deſperation proceeds out of a fear of God, and horrour of ſinne: deſperation may conſiſt with faith thus farre, that a man may have a true and faithfull opinion in the generall, that there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes to be had in the Church, and yet have a corrupt imagination in the particular, that to him in this ſinfull eſtate that he is in, this remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes ſhall not be applied; ſo that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10526:90"/> reſolution of the School is good, <hi>Deſperatio poteſt eſſe ex ſolo exceſſu boni, Deſperation may proceed out of exceſſe of that which is good in it ſelf,</hi> from any exceſſive over-fearing of Gods juſtice, from an exceſſive over-hating thine own ſinnes. <hi>Et vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute quis malè utitur?</hi> can any man make ſo ill uſe of ſo great vertues as the fear of God and hatred of ſinne? yes, they may: ſo forward a weed is ſinne, as that it can ſpring out of any root: and therefore if it have done ſo in thee, and thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by haſt made thy caſe the harder, yet know ſtill, that <hi>Objectum ſpei eſt arduum &amp; poſsibile,</hi> The true object of hope is that which is hard to come by, yet poſſible to come by. And therefore as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>By my God have I leapt over the wall,</hi> ſo by thy <note place="margin">2. Sam. 22. 30.</note> God thou muſt break through the wall, through this wall of obduration which thou thy ſelf haſt begun to build about thy ſelf. Feather thy wings again, which even the flames of hell have touched in theſe beginnings of deſperation; feather them again with this text, <hi>Neminem judicat,</hi> Chriſt judgeth no man ſo as a deſperate man judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: do not make thy ſelf beleeve that thou haſt ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt, for this is the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſtep thou haſt made unto it, to think that thou haſt done it: walk in that field, in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of God, and from the firſt flower at the entrance, the flower of Paradiſe, <hi>Semen mulieris,</hi> the generall promiſe that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpents head, to the laſt word of that Meſſias upon the croſſe, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:10526:91"/> that all that was promiſed for us, is now perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and from the firſt to the laſt thou ſhalt finde the ſavour of life in all thoſe flowers: walk over the ſame alley again, and conſider the firſt man Adam in the beginning, who involved thee in originall ſinne, and the thief upon the croſſe, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in actuall ſinnes all his life, and ſealed all with the ſinne of reviling Chriſt himſelf, and a little before his expiration, and yet recovered Paradiſe that day; and ſee if thou canſt make any ſhift to exclude thy ſelf. Receive the fragrancie of all theſe cordialls, <hi>Vivit Dominus, As the Lord liveth, I would not the death of a ſinner; Quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque, At what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth,</hi> and of this text, <hi>Neminem judicat,</hi> Chriſt judgeth no man to deſtruction here; and if thou finde after all theſe antidotes a ſuſpicious aire, a ſuſpicious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that <hi>Impoſsibile eſt,</hi> that <hi>it is impoſsible for them who were once enlightened, if they fall away, to renew them again by repentance;</hi> ſprinkle upon that wormwood of <hi>Impoſsibile eſt,</hi> that Manna of <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remiſeritis, Whoſe ſinnes ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;</hi> and then it will have another taſte of thee, and then thou wilt ſee that that impoſſibilitie lies onely upon them who are utterly fallen away into an abſolute apoſtaſie and infidelitie, that make a mock of Chriſt, and crucifie him again, as it is expreſſed there; who undervalue and deſpite the Church of God, and thoſe means which Chriſt Jeſus hath inſtituted in his Church for renewing of ſuch as are fallen. To ſuch it is impoſſible,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10526:91"/> becauſe there are no other ordinarie means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: but that is not thy caſe, thy caſe is onely a doubt that thoſe means that are ſhall not be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee. And even that is a ſlipperie ſtate, to doubt of the mercie of God to thee in particular: this goes ſo neare making thy ſinne greater then Gods mercie, as that it makes thy ſinne greater then dayly adulteries, dayly murders, dayly blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, dayly profaning of the ſabbath could have done. And though thou canſt never make that true in this life, that thy ſinnes are greater then God can forgive; yet this is a way to make them greater then God will forgive.</p>
                  <p>Now to collect both our exerciſes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject both texts, Chriſt judgeth all men, and Chriſt judgeth no man; he claims all judgement, and he diſavows all judgement; &amp; they conſiſt well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was at our creation, but that was not his firſt ſcene. The <hi>Arians,</hi> though they ſay, <hi>Erat quando non erat,</hi> There was a time when Chriſt was not, (intimating that he had a beginning, and therefore was a creature) yet they will allow that he was created before the generall creation, and ſo aſſiſted at ours. But he was infinite generations before that, in the boſome of his Father, at our election; and there in him was executed the firſt judgement of ſeparating thoſe which were his, the elect from the reprobate: And then he knows who are his by that firſt judgement, and ſo comes to his ſecond judgement, to ſeal all thoſe in the viſible Church with the outward mark of his Baptiſme, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10526:92"/> inward mark of his Spirit. And thoſe whom he calls ſo, he juſtifies, ſanctifies, and brings them to this third judgement, to an eſtabliſhed and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall glory; and ſo all judgement is his. But then to judge out of humane affections and paſſions, by detraction and calumnie, as they did to whom he ſpake at this time, ſo he judgeth no man, ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth judgement. To uſurp upon this juriſdiction of others, or to exerciſe any other judgement then was in his commiſſion, as his pretended Vicar does, ſo he judges no man, ſo he diſavows all judgement: to judge ſo as that our condemnation may be irremediable in this life, ſo he judgeth no man, ſo he forſweares all judgement. <hi>As I live,</hi> ſaith the Lord of hoſts, and, <hi>As I have died,</hi> ſaith the Lord Jeſus, I judge none. Acknowledge his firſt judgement, thy election in him; cheriſh his ſecond judgement, thy juſtification by him; breathe and pant after the third judgement, thy crown of glorie for him: intend not upon the right of other men, which is the firſt; defame not, calumniate not other men, which is the ſecond; lay not the name of reprobate in this life upon any man, which is the third judgement that Chriſt diſavows here; and then thou ſhalt have well underſtood and well practiſed both theſe texts, <hi>The Father hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all judgement to the Sonne,</hi> and yet <hi>The Sonne judgeth no man.</hi>
